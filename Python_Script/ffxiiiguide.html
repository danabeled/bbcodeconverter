</p>There is a tutorial to watch if you haven't played the game before.  
<br> 
<br><p>Your first fight in the world of Final Fantasy XIII is a simple one. Just keep hitting Auto-Battle after the tutorial, and you'll do great. Not a whole lot to do there.  Press X  or A to choose Auto_battle or use the left analog stick to select abilities or Items, press
</p><p>X  or A to confirm your choice. Be quick! Battles are in real time. Press start to pause in game, Cut Scenes or in battle.

<br><p>Ok for this one either Auto battle again or use Blitz in your abilities tab. Blitz is a nifty attack that hits all enemies in a limited radius. It's rather handy when there are several stronger enemies to defeat at once.  Heal when needed and watch out for Warmech's new attack. Rapid use of auto-battle will knock down Warmech's hp before it can KO Lighting, that being said keep and eye on her Hp! Watch the handy cut scene and maybe learn some new stuff about our pink haired main character.
</p> 
<br>After the Scene you get control of our main character and can finally move around.
<br> 
<br><p>Now I give you the most important gamer tip of all, SAVE AND SAVE OFTEN! So  save at the Panel and get ready for some fun.
</p> 
<br><p>Start by moving forward following the compass on the mini map, till you see 2 Wardens. Run up to them to start battle. These guys are pushovers, (2 hits man!) just beat them till they cry for their moms and the battle ends. Run towards the seemingly impassible wall and use the swirly blue circle to climb over the wall and to the next area. At the base of the wall once you land there are 2 more PSICOM Wardens to beat up.
</p> 
<br><p>The next group of PSICOM guys includes in Enforcers. These guys are a little stronger than their Warden brothers but still easy enough to beat. Again Auto-Battle is a good way to go.  Remember to try a catch them in the back to get the jump on them.  
</p> 
<br><p>After the fight use the blue circle again to jump over the rubble in the way. Up ahead there is a treasure sphere ahead on the left. Walk up to it and press x or A to open it and collect your potion. 
</p> 
<br><p>Battle your way to the end of the causeway. You'll know if you're going the right way if you hit a cut scene at the end of the road and not the save point again. After the cut scene you'll be thrown into battle with a PSICOM Warden and two Pantherons. This is a good time to try that Blitz attack if you haven't already.  Heal when you see Lighting's health dropping to the yellow. If she dies your game is over man. So keep an eye on her or your party leaders health! If you get game over you have to restart from the last checkpoint or save point, so keep that in mind and always have a few potions on hand. 
</p> 
<br><p>After the fight straight ahead there is a save point, next to another wall of rubble and a jump/climb blue circle, climb the stairs to the right before going over the wall and collect 2 potions from the treasure sphere on the platform.  Go back and jump over the wall o' Rubble to the next section.
</p> 
<br><p>Past the latest wall o' rubble there will be a PISCOM enforcer and a Aerial Recon guy waiting. Take them out and move ahead. Don't forget to run up the near by stairs and pick up the Iron Bangle from the sphere on the platform.
</p>I suggest equipping the Bangle as soon as you get it.
<br> 
<br><p>To equip accessories hit triangle or Y to open the Menu. Scroll down to equipment and then choose the character you want to equip. In this case I suggest putting the bangle on Lighting.  Press Circle or B to exit out and move on down the cause way. 
</p> 
<br><p>There is a path you have to take, look for the blue jump/climb circles on the ground for the right path. Once beyond all that, be sure to turn around and collect 50 gil from the treasure sphere between the boxes.
</p> 
<br><p>Ahead is a group of PSICOM Wardens. Take them out and move on. Make your way through the mini maze of boxes and then get ready for another tutorial battle, this time on items.  You will fight a Pantheron and a PISCOM Warden.
</p> 
<br><p>After the battle there is a quick cut scene. There is a battle with 3 pantherons and a PIISCOM Warden. Again use Auto-Battle, since the Battle AI is usually good about using blitz when needed and watch Lighting's health, heal her when needed. After the battle move up the stairs to where Sazh is waiting.  Jump down and use the red/pink circle on the ground to activate the sky bridge and move to the next level of the area.
</p> 
<br><p>Ahead there are several PSICOM guys waiting. One of them is the PISCOM Marauder. This guy can be scary, but don't freak out just yet. This is another Tutorial Battle this time on Attack Chains. Watch it or just dive right in, but get ready for a fight.  This teaches us about the fun stagger gauge at the top right of the screen.
</p> 
<br><p>Take out the Marauder first then the Enforcers. Be sure to keep an eye on her health.(really this early in the game that's a thing).  After the fight there is a cut scene and we learn a little more about our hero and what she's about.  Watch and again be in awe.
</p> 
<br><p>After the Cut scene we are a new guy, literally. This big hulking chunk of man is Snow.  So let's as Snow!
</p> 
<br><p>From the starting point turn around and collect 50 gil from the treasure sphere, then move forward towards the save point. I suggest saving again. Shops are in save points to make things all nice and neat. Pick up any items you might need and move on.  Use the blue circle on the ground to jump/climb over the crane in the way. Watch a cut scene and then move to the fight.
</p> 
<br>TOKEN BABE IN SKIMPY CLOTHING WITH A BIG GUN!! Sorry but she is.
<br> 
<br><p>Anyway back to the fight. Stomp the PISCOM Enforcer guys and move ahead. There are a series of battles along this causeway, both Wardens, Enforcers, and Pantherons. Watch Snow's health and heal when needed.  Just fight you're way to the end of the cause way all the while enjoying colorful commentary.  You know you're going the right way when you hit a cut Scene.  The masses are rising up!   Ok so once the people are armed and ready, set out. Hit the Treasure sphere and collect an Iron Bangle. Move on towards the save point and save before moving on, cause we are all gamers and that is the first rule of gaming. Save and Save often.  (it's the 3D Modelers Creed too).
</p>
<br><p>Fight your way down the cause way. Keep in mind your health, and LOOK OUT BEHEMOTH! Don't freak out, just use Auto-Battle and keep you head level and you'll do fine.  One of your party will heal you if needed. Just kick Behemoth butt and take names.
</p> 
<br><p>Watch the rather sad cut scene and get ready to move on again. This time we are back as Lighting and we are fighting right after the cut Scene. Myrmidon is easy enough to beat. Just mash X or A and the battle will be over quickly. Keep an eye on your health and be ready to heal. You may have to heal at least once before the Mech falls. Watch at cut scenes to find out some really foggy stuff about our characters. 
</p> 
<br><p>After the Cut Scene we are Snow again.  Run forward and pick up a Power Circle from the Treasure Sphere ahead, then move on to the fight. You should have a good idea on battles now, so battle away!
</p> 
<br><p>Take the Stairs on the left, and the platform over to the other side of the boxes. On the ground level there is a final treasure sphere for this chapter containing 100 gil. Collect it and move up the stairs to continue on to the cut scene, which will then throw you into battle with some PSICOM Enforcers and a Warden.  After the battle run forward and examine the bikes to move on.
</p> 
<br><p>Watch the Cut Scene and  save right after. We are now playing as a kid named Hope.  After saving run towards Vanille and a cut scene will start taking us to the next chapter.
</p> 
<br><p>Save your game and get ready to move on.  At this point I suggest making different saves for each of the chapter starts, that way you can go back If you need to with out having to play a bunch over again.

<br>Fortisol
<br>100 Gil
<br>Power Wristband
<br>Potion(X5)
<br> 
<br><b>Game Play</b>
<br> 
<br><p>Watch the cut scene, and again get ready for fun and fights.  Hope and Vanille aren't he pushovers you'd think they are.  Both can hold their own.  To the left of the start point is a save point.  Down the stairs behind the start point and all the way to across is a treasure sphere with 30 gil in it. Collect it and return to the start point.
</p><p>Now head up the stairs in front of the start point and head to the left towards the free range enemies. Fight or flight it's up to you.  Head to the left to pick up 4 potions from the treasure sphere.  Head back the way we came to continue on.
</p> 
<br><b>Fun Fact,</b>
<br><p>If you want to farm Fortisol and Deceptisol you can here. Each are common drops in the Sacrarium area where you play as Hope and Vanille. To make enemies respawn just exit to Oblatorium and re-enter the Sacrarium area.   These Shrouds are great for later game play.
</p> 
<br><p>After collecting our potions go down the stairs across from the start point. If you run into a pop up on the screen explaining Aggression and Preemptive strikes then you're going the right way. Carry on towards a group of Zwerg Scandroids after the fight collect  an Iron Bangle from the sphere on the left.  Use the blue circle on the ground to jump over the rubble made upon our entry. At the bottom you will come face to face with a pair of Pantheron, kick GC butt or flee up to you again.  Walk forward till you get  a cut scene explaining a few things and get ready to carry on.
</p> 
<br><p>After the cut scene we have a little game as Snow.  Be sure to turn around from the start point and collect 2 potions from the sphere at the top of the stairs.  Move to the save point and then on to the green light stick thing they've left up for you, fighting or fleeing as needed. Keep an eye on Snow's health and heal when needed.  Poke the glow stick of destiny to activate the House of Stairs and start the elevator.
</p> 
<br><p>Watch another Cut Scene and get ready to play as Lighting and Sazh again. Yay for pink haired chicks with Swords!! Read the tutorial on Shrouds and use them as needed.  Again you can farm for them in the Sacrarium area as Hope and Vanille.
</p> 
<br>Access the save point if you wish and move forward up the stairs.
<br><p>Deceptisol is nice here  you can run around and get the drop on the free range critters running around.  Remember our Mech friend? Well it's back and it's still kicking. Take it to the junk heap and  carry on my wayward gamer up the stairs after collecting a Phoenix Down from the sphere on the left as you face the stairs. Up the stairs are some scandroids and a patheron , along with a sphere containing Gladius
</p><p>Equip this to Lighting and carry on up the stairs. Our Mech friend is back with a Patheron. Fight or use a shroud to get by them and again move on till you get a cut scene.
</p> 
<br><p>Back as Snow turn around from the start point and go down the stairs to collect 2 potions from the sphere. Touch the Glow stick again and start the next set of  movements going.  Basically call the elevator. Run to the end of the walkway and board the platform.
</p> 
<br>CUT SCENE!!! Yay!!
<br> 
<br><p>Now back as Hope and Vanille head up the stairs and across the bridge to collect Fortisol from the Sphere.  Now head back down the stairs and to the door to move on. Again you can defeat all the enemies in the area to farm for the shrouds.
</p> 
<br><p>Then run down the cause way fight the Patherons and collect 100 gil from the sphere.  Carry on towards the way point marker. Yay another cut scene that yet again throws us into battle.
</p> 
<br><p>This time we are up against  Cie'th. These buggers can be nasty, but keep your guard up and your eye on your health and you'll do fine.  There will be a cut scene right after the battle. 
</p> 
<br><p>After the cut scene, you're Lighting and Sazh again. So battle your way through the Cei'th  From the starting point go left to collect a Power Wristband and then head up the stairs. Either Fight or use a Shroud to get past the Cei'th populating this area.  There is a large  critter blocking your way. Take him out and move on.
</p> 
<br><b>SAVE YOUR GAME!  </b>
<br><p>There is a boss fight coming up. You will have to battle your way past a hall of Cei'th but there is a boss fight.  At the end of the Hall there is a Cut Scene,  a rather sad one.  Learning a little more about our Heroes we get to that boss fight I promised you. Again save your game and collect 5 potions from the sphere near by. Use a Fortisol if you have one and  get ready for our first really boss fight of the game! Right after a cut scene.

<br><p>Now this fight can be taxing, so stick with it and remember to heal as needed. Take out the Manipulators first. They will come back after a while but they are the way Anima attacks. So take those out and you're good to go. It should take around 3 or 4 times of  removing the arms to defeat Anima.  A few notes that might be helpful in this fight and later on. Early attacks are possible by hitting the triangle/A button with the ATB gauge filled and the Auto-Battle option highlighted, or when you have an action queued. This means you don't have to wait for you entire ATB to fill up to take one action to finish off an enemy with a little health left.
</p><p>To cancel commands use the circle/B button. This will remove anything you have queued and allow you to input new commands, in the heat of battle.
</p> 
<br>(Any one else remember when Anima was an awesome Summons? What happened to that?)  
<br> 
<br><p>Note Doctor's Code that you get for defeating Anima is a nifty thing. It doubles the effects of potions used when equipped. So you might want to thing about Equiping it to your party leader.  After the battle there will be a cut scene. We will be starting the next chapter after that.  Save your game when prompted and Congrats on beating your first in game boss of Final Fantasy XIII!

<br><b>Game Play</b>
<br> 
<br>Chapter starts with a cut Scene.  Yay!! Crystal Lake!
<br> 
<br><p>Ok so here we are, you might think this is a pretty sweet lake but WRONG! Things are waiting to eat you around every corner and that's not nice. So we start with chapter with a tutorial on Paradigms. Pay attention this. It will be important though out the rest of the game.  There are 6  different roles that each character can fill. Only 4 are open at the moment.
</p> 
<br><p>Commandos are physical fighters, in battle. As a general rule they inflict more damage than Ravagers. Some of the Commando attacks have special effects to them.
</p> 
<br><p>Ravagers are magic users, like offensive magic users.  They can use the elemental magic that we are so use to having in out Final Fantasy Games. Auto-Battle works best as the Battle AI will tailor spells to do the most damage to an enemy.
</p> 
<br><p>Medics are heals and support magic users.  They will use spells to boost stats of the party, remove negative effects and restore HP.
</p> 
<br><p>Sentinels are tanks. Using Defensive boosts and special attacks they will take the brunt of the enemy attacks and then dish out the damage back to the enemy. Really hand to have.
</p> 
<br><p>I'm not going in to Paradigms as there are quite a few of them. I will cover what Paradigms you would want to use in boss fights and what roles make up those Paradigms.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>So now that we know abou Paradigms and we can use magic to kick butt, let's carry on with our game.  There's nothing behind you to collect so follow your team mates down the slope to another cut scene. (there are a lot of them at this point)
</p> 
<br><p>Then we get a tutorial on the Crystarium and what it does for us. I'm not going to tell you in what way to develop your characters but I will make suggestions as to what abilities you might want to have along the way.
</p> 
<br><p>I highly suggest that you level up Hope and Vanille's Medic roles, Lighting's Commando, then Ravager role, Snow's Ravager and Sazh's Ravager first. Then work on the others. Later in the game Lighting will be a Ravager power house, but for now we'd like to have her physical power in our corner.
</p> 
<br><p>Right now I recommend a Paradigm with a Medic, A Ravager and a Commando.  This one is called Diversity.  It's one of the better ones, I think. Be sure to hit square/X to  set it as your default Paradigm.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so moving on, there  is a save point at the fork, I suggest using it, then moving on down the other fork to find a sphere with the Pearlwing Staff in it.  Equip this to Vanille and go down the fork with the save point.  Note at this point in the game I suggest fighting all the battles you can.  The CP will come in handy later on.  
</p> 
<br><p>Anyway jump up on your right and collect Chipped Fang (X7) before moving on. Use the blue swirly circle of Jumpness to get over the debris. After the jumping there is a sphere to your right again with 200 gil in it. Collect this and move on to the next area.
</p> 
<br><p>And Yet another Cut Scene! Yay for Cut Scenes that through us in to battles! Watch the tutorial and beat the PISCOM guys up and get back to me when you're done. Don't worry I'll wait.
</p> 
<br>Did you beat them? Good! Let's move on!
<br>
<br><p>Alright here we go again, right of the bat, there is sphere down the right fork coming from Stilled Waters, grab the Cie”th Tears(X5) and move on. Heading down the path the fork on the left has a sphere with a Silver bangle waiting for the looting. Take it and then return to the save point. From the save point head down the really long path. At the end there are two spheres one to the left and one to the right.  The one on the left contains a Phoenix Down and the one on the right contains 50 gil. Grab these up as you go by. Just a little ways down from these on the left there is another sphere with  strange fluid (X8) in it, and just up from that down the fork on the left is a sphere with Magician's Mark.  Collect these and head on towards A Silent Maelstrom.
</p> 
<br><p>Save your game at the save point right at the start of the Maelstrom, Remember our old friend Manasivn Warmech? It's Back and it's looking to eat you, so to speak, right after a cut scene.  Anyway at the save point upgrade if you can and be ready for a fight.  Equip your new Magician's mark if you wish and be sure to have a good set of players on your side. There is also a tutorial on paradigm trouts at the start of this battle, watch if needed, if not have a good fight. I suggest paradigm shifting to a paradigm with ravagers and a commando when the Mech is staggered The fight wont last as long if you do this, but be sure to either use potions or shift again to heal as needed.
</p> 
<br><p>After the fight go on through to the Encase in Crystal area.  The first fork on the right is more of a loop but at the end there is a sphere with more strange fluid(X6) for the taking. Take the left path when you come to two skinny paths, on the left there are 2 spheres, one with 240 gil and one with Deneb Duellers, Equip the new weapon and go back.
</p> 
<br><p>Take the right path this time and curve around to the right. Take the thin path there to find a sphere containing Enigmatic Fluid(X6). Head back the way you came and continue on. Ahead on the right there is a sphere with Wicked Fang(X7) across from the sphere there is a mini event. Examine the thing when promoted and then make your way across the bridge.  Just beyond the bridge there is a save point, use it if you need. Up from the save point is a battle with the Alpha Behemoth, it's another Tutorial battle. Watch the tutorial if needed and kick butt. It takes a bit to stagger and you'll probably want to defeat it before it finishes charging it's Extermination Mode attack. This will knock out 300 HP with each hit. After the battle there is another cut scene.
</p> 
<br><p>Follow Vanille on the right fork there is a sphere with Librascope in it.  Continue around till you hit a cut scene. On the right there is a sphere with Digital Circuits(X2) right before the entrance to The Frozen falls.
</p> 
<br><p>Take the right jump path to the 2 spheres containing Paraffin Oil (X2) and 50 Gil.  Keep going to the top and you will encounter a Watchdrone and a Cironia Velocycle. You want to take out the Watchdrone first and keep an eye on your hp, heal when needed.  Remember when the Cycle staggers use the relentless assault or a paradigm like it to take it out faster.  Use the save point if needed and behind you in an alcove Sort of a small jump down from where you fought the last battle, there is another sphere with Insulated Cabling(X3) in it for the taking.
</p> 
<br><p>After grabbing your goodies, upgrade your characters if you can and move on to the Mirror Morass. On the right as you travel there will be a sphere with 30 gil in it. Around the bend there will be another to the right that will have a Begrimed Claws(X6). Grab them up and move on to the next area.
</p> 
<br><p>Right inside the Gates of Antiquity there is a save point.  Ok here there is another Alpha Behemoth. Either try and sneak up on it or use a shroud to get the drop on it. Remember to take it out fast before it can charge up that nasty attack. On the right at the top of the stairs there is a sphere containing 600 gil.
</p> 
<br><p>Move on up the stairs and on the right there is a sphere with 2 digital Circuits waiting to be collected. You jump up on the right, following your fight with the Behemoth or you can charge forward from the fight into a group of waiting baddies.
</p> 
<br><p>After collecting your goodies and the optional fight carry on up the ramp like thing to the left and on towards the Forgotten Commons. Cross the small bridge and on the right there is a sphere containing 7 more Begrimed Claws. Collect them and then move towards the hole in the floor. Moving around to the left there is a sphere with a spark ring waiting to be claimed.  There are PSICOM baddies waiting here and the Crusader can be a bit of a pain to take it easy and watch your health.
</p> 
<br><p>After collecting what you want from the Commons and fighting any battles you may wish to, move on towards A City no Longer. Right off the bat there is a sphere with 3 potions in it on the left. Grab it as you sort of pass by.  Use the save point at the top of the stairs, from here you can do two things. One is go the long way around and collect Millerite then return to where you started by the save point or you can just go ahead and jump across to the next area.  Going around gives you the chance to gain more CP.  I suggest going and getting the sphere around here. Be ware of the PSICOM Executioner, this guy is fast and strong and only takes about half the damage from any of your attacks.
</p> 
<br><b>Side note:</b>
<br><p>If I didn't say so before you want to work on Lighting's Commando first then her Ravager. Vanille's Medic then Ravager, Hope's Medic, then Synergist then ravager. Sazh's ravager is all that you can work on with him at this point. Try to get all of these roles up to the point where you can't go any higher. You will be thankful you did later on. With Snow, work on his Ravager, then Commando, the Sentinel.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>After taking either route around,  through the pillars and up the stairs on the right, there is another sphere containing Ferroelectic Film. After getting the film if you did, you can jump down and run for the hills or you can fight the group of baddies. Either way use the save point at the top of the stairs,  collect the sphere to the left of and right behind the save point, equip the spark ring to your party leader, level Sazh's Ravager till he knows Areo and dig in for a fight.
</p>

<br><p>The first part of this fight is rather straight forward. Beat it till it gives up, keeping in mind to heal and using relentless assault when the thing is staggered.  Then beat it some moreUse Libra to get info on the boss, and have your ravagers beat it with Areo .
</p> 
<br>Easy right?

<br><p>Ok so for the second part of this fight the Boss is much stronger. You need to keep an eye on your party's health and heal when needed. Stagger the beast, as fast as you can, since once staggered the beastie is susceptible to Areo magic again.  Still not to bad of a fight if you got Sazh's Ravager to learn Areo and stayed on top of you healing.
</p> 
<br><p>Sazh  and Vanille will learn the Synergist and Saboteur roles after the battle in addition to getting a sliver bangle, access to the Up in Arms store from the save points.
</p> 
<br><p>Watch the cut scene and rest a little on your laurels. Save when prompted. And yay we're back to Snow's story. 
</p> 
<br><p>After the cut scene we will enter into several unfair battles against PSICOM guys, then we get to do something new. It's called and Eidolon Battle. This one is as Snow against Shiva.  (Yet another FF staple) After the cool cut scene where the twins are introduced we fight them.  Watch the tutorial if needed, then proceed to take names. (Nix and Shiva)
</p> 
<br><p>If you don't get it the first time don't worry you get another shot. While Nix is attacking you Shiva is healing so you don't have to worry about your health in this one. Now you may want to try a few things to see what works best but,  you can always use Libra to find out what will cause each one to follow you so to speak. Now there is  fun way to do this, using Sentinel. If you engage Steelguard right before Nix attacks, the trick is to fill the Gestalt gauge before  your time runs out. Retry if needed and just remember you can skip cut scenes in this one if needed. Cancel you guard if Nix preforms ATB Charge. This will not count for you. Once the gauge is filled hit square/B to end the battle.
</p> 
<br><p>Congrats! You've got your first summons!! Now sit back and again and watch a Cut scene.  Save when asked and get ready to start the next chapter!
</p> 
<br>Congrats You've made it to chapter 4!

<br>Game Play:
<br> 
<br><p>Ok so we start off with a cut scene for this chapter, then a shot battle against some Patheron. Really easy stuff, just take some names and you'll do great. Ok so now we're starting out as Sazh for a bit. Head over the bridge where Vanille is waiting. watch some pretty pretty cut scenes and learn a little more about our characters. oh look at that Lighting is legal. 
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so after the mimi movie, we're Lighting and Hope. Ok so read the tutorial on the primer if needed and get ready to be awesome. I can't really tell you enough how much you want to upgrade hope's medic role. I really mean that. You're gonna want home to be able to heal Lighting as you go around. So that's my 2 cents. To the right from the save point there is a blue jump ring on the ground that will take you to a little alcove. There's a treasure sphere there with a Librascope in it. Ok go to the left from the save point continue forward fighting baddies along the way. Use the blue jump rings to get aorund the circular thing and the little island near by. Once across and around just keep moving towards Another Mans Treasure. Once there a cut scene will take place. 
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>Now we've got to get Sazh and Vanille to where Hope and Lighting are waiting. So travel on till you come to where a group of robots are fighting each other. Take out the pulsework guys first and watch your health. After the fight use the magnet to pull the big piece of junk forward. Now go around and head towards Another Man's Treasure. There is  sphere on the left in front of the tunnel that you will have to defeat the group of fighting baddies to get. Again they will fight among themselves, for a bit and then they will start attacking you. in this case i would leave the pulse work guy for last, since that keeps the other baddies from attacking you for a while. Once the baddies are taken care of gather your booty from the sphere and carry on through the tunnel. Faith and Bravery are good things to have coming up. Try and get Sazh there, it really doesn't take much. Vigilance is nice but really you want that magic and attack boost. ALWAYS BE SURE TO HAVE A PARADIGM WITH AT LEAST  ONE MEDIC. This will be necessary from this point forward. Ok so carry on through the tunnel and hit the switch to make the stuff go away. You are now nearly there. Lighting and Hope are waiting! Again if you sneak up on the baddies leave the pulse work guys for last, the more they fight each other the better off you are. Run forward and meet up with your missing team mates. After the cut scene, follow Lighting. Be sure to upgrade Hope's roles. If yo fought all the baddies while as Sazh and Vanille, you should have enough CP to get Hope's Ravager to the next level cap. After that work on his Medic. Equip an iron bangle or silver bangle on the boy to boost his hp and then check your paradigms. you now have the ability to have  Evened Odds, which is a Synergist, a Saboteur and a Medic, Guerilla, which is a Ravager, a Saboteur and a Synergist, and Thaumaturgy, which is 2 Ravagers, and a medic. The last one is actually one of my faves to use, this keeps your hp, and still allows you to kick baddie butt. So take a look at the paradigms you can build and play around before moving on. You're starting battle Paradigm will be Tri-Disaster if you don't change it. To set any Paradigm as your active paradigm just hit Square/X. You should also make Smart Bomb. It's 2 ravagers and a saboteur, its great for staggering stronger baddies. once staggered switch to tri-disaster or Thaumaturgy if you need to heal. 
</p> 
<br><p>Now we are ready to move on. Use the blue jump rings on the ground to climb up to the ledge. Fight the Pulsework guy if you want and collect the Sphere near by before carrying on. 
</p><p>Use the save point on the left and be on the look out. there will be a pulse work guy coming out of a funny door in front of you and a pair of Incubus jumping down on you. Use the blue circles again to jump over some stuff in the part off the map that looks like a nose. keep going and o the left in an alcove there will be 2 spheres and a save point. 
</p> 
<br><p>Move on and keep any eye out for baddies as you do, using the blue jump rings make you way down the cause way towards the next save point. Save there and upgarde your characters.  You'll run into Lighting again after the save point. Yay! Upgrade Lighting's roles, and update your paradigms. Relentless Assault should be ok for the near future but be sure to keep a Paradigm handy for healing. Lighting will now replace Hope in your party but you still want to have Smart bomb in your deck of Paradigm. 
</p> 
<br><p>After adding Lighting back to the party, you'll come across an electrical panel, activate it to reveal stairs. Be careful not to miss the sphere hiding just inside an open door right after the save point. Now there is a short cut on the left that will take you around the encounters, but it's really best to fight the baddies for the CP and spoils. Remember even if they aren't in your party right now they still earn CP for later. So it's always best if you can to fight the baddies roaming around. On the right path there is also a sphere, containing an Ember Ring. Equip the Ember Ring and get ready for a fight. Save at the next save point and make sure you have smart bomb in your Paradigm deck.

<br><p>This is a two part battle. Use smart bomb, so Vanille as a Saboteur can cast Deportect and Deshell on Dreadnought. This will help because at first this baddie takes half the magical and physical damage you deal out. The goal of the first part of this battle is to stagger the baddie and reduce it's HP in order to reveal it's true nature. Keep an eye on your health, you may have to heal once or twice during the first part of this battle. Dreadnought will use an ability called Steam Clean that will remove one negative stat at a time. Don't worry about this at this point of the battle, just stay in Smart Bomb unless you need to heal and work on staggering that Mech. Once staggered a shot cut scene will happen and the second part will begin.

</td></tr><br> 
<br><p>Ok so the good thing is that if you were close to dying and didn't get to heal before the intermission, your party is fully healed and ready to kick mech butt, however this isn't going to be too easy to do. Now here's where things get a little tricky. You'll want Vanille to cast Deprotect and Deshell again, but you also want Sazh to cast Faith and Bravery, Vigilance doesn't hurt either if you have it. Relentless Assault is the best way to damage the boss. Some of the Mech's attacks are heavy hitters, like Wrecking Ball. (I'm going to pass on the jokes here) so be ready to shift fast after or before to heal right away. Don't worry if you don't get it the first time, you always have retry. If you don't have the right set of Paradigms you can always hit retry at the star of battle. Again you should try to stagger the Mech as fast as you can with buffing up your self and debuffing the mech.  
</p> 
<br><p>Once the mech falls your party gets 360 Cp and a Crystarium upgrade. The medic role is now open to Lighting and Sazh can use Commando role. When upgrading the Cystarium it's best to focus on Light's Commando and Ravager roles first. Her medic already knows Cure so no real worries there; again her medic role has the option for a second accessory slot, which is a boon. With Hope you should focus on his Medic and Ravager roles, get them to the role cap, then work on Synergist. You also get the Omni-kit and access to Lenora's Garage. With the Omni-kit you can now upgrade your weapons and accessories. Take some time and look over what you can do. Upgrading is a great way to get good weapons for little or no gil. You can also instead of selling unwanted weapons and accessories; you can dismantle them for their parts to upgrade other weapons. 
</p> 
<br><p>So now go up the ramp to the upper level and at the next save point upgrade your weapons and characters equip Ninurta on hope and save. Lighting's Medic role offers the chance to have an extra accessory slot, so if you want go that way you can. At this point upgrading your characters is up to you. Ok so after the save point there is a cut scene, people loose their tempers and stuff is said, but anyway, carry on. The party splits up again and we're thrown into a fight with Lighting and Hope.
</p> 
<br><p>Right after the battle there is another cut scene and then we get to start play again as Light and Hope. Use the save point on the right and keep going along the trail. There is a sphere to the left of the path a ways up from the save point guarded by 2 PISCOM Regulars. Battles here are easy enough keep and eye on your health and unless Light is about to die it's easier to take the quick victory than to heal. The PISCOM Gunner and Regulars aren't much of a challenge. At some point along the trail you'll meet a funny little mech called Uhlan. Same thing applies here, just keep hitting it and heal when needed. 
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>Just up before the second save point there is a sphere in an alcove on the right side of the map. Collect your booty from the sphere, save and get ready for a mini game. 
</p> 
<br><b>Pulse Armament Mini Game</b>.
<br> 
<br><p>This is kind of fun to play. You're controlling a dreadnought, and your goal is to wipe out the other guys. There are those little robots to take out along the way. You only get 3 sweeping kills per-gate, but if you use them you can just step on the buggers. At the end of the game you encounter 2 spheres. These contain your prizes for completing simple goals during the mini game. They range in value and what not and are as follows. 
</p> 
<br>Sweeping Blow Kills (the attack with X or A)
<br>40+ give you 999 gil
<br>25-39 gives you 300 gil
<br>24 or less gives you 100 gil
<br> 
<br>Total kills
<br>35+ give you Spark Ring
<br>25-34 gives you Thickened Hide (X20)
<br>24 or less gives you sturdy bone (X10)
<br> 
<br><p>From here go through the tunnel collect the sphere and use the save point. If you encounter a PISCOM Ranger take them out first or else they will cast protect or shell on their buddies. Create a new Paradigm called Symbiosis, which consists of Medic and Synergist. Set this to your default choice when starting battle. Equip all the spark rings you have, which if you killed all the little robots should be 2 one for each character. 
</p><p>And if you can upgrade them. You're getting ready for another  Eidolon Battle, this time with Odin. (Yet another FF staple)
</p> 
<br><p>Where the road splits take the upper path to find a sphere containing a Spark ring. I suggest collecting this if you didn't get one from the mini game. Use the blue ring to jump down or go back the way you came. Where the road splits again jump up to collect a sphere, then keeping moving forward. You can at this point either go through the tunnel and avoid the Uhlan or you can fight it. I suggest fighting it. You'll want the cp. 
</p>After the fight with Uhlan there is a save point use it, cause your about to fight Odin.
<br> 
<br><b>Eidolon Battle-Odin</b>
<br> 
<br><p>This is probably the hardest battle so far. Odin yields to those who heal the wounded, but that isn't enough to defeat this guy. Start with Symbiosis as your default Paradigm. Wait till hope has cast both Shell and Protect on both party members if you want to win this battle. Once that's been done switch to War and Peace. (Commando and medic) this allows Light to attack, which Hope heals. Watch Odin closely as soon as he preforms Ullr's Shield switch to dualcasting to and allow the ravagers to drive up his gauge. The second he starts attacking again switch back to War and Peace.  If you have Forisol and Aegisol you can forgo the first buffing phase, this will make the fight faster and easier, allowing you to use dualcasting to fill odin's gauge while switching to Double dose Medic & Medic, if you need to heal. 
</p> 
<br><p>After the battle Light gains the Odin Eidolith and an extra ATB gauge. After the cut scene there is a little tutorial on using Eidolons in battle. Nifty! We have summons that we can actually use not just fight and effectively loose. (With all the rose petals flying around I expect Haruka and Michiu from Sailor Moon to show up or something) Anyway now we have a nifty spiffy summons that'll come in handy. So after the battle tutorial on Eidolon fighting, a nice cut scene happens and then we move on. Save when prompted.  
</p> 
<br><p>After the cut scene we're back as Sazh and Vanille. Remember they went the other way. So here we are. We need the Undermine Paradigm. It's Ravager and Saboteur; this is really good for beating up the pulsework guys. Active the device on the map and save if you want to again. Do take note that Bombs in this game look more like D&D dice than Bombs, so be careful. The Bombs Self Destruct is rather nasty. Take them out in any battle before they can blow you up with them. Ok so there are a few spheres here that you can't get to just yet. You need to get power up to the area first. However along the way you can collect Auric Amulet from the platform before jumping down to where the second save point is, an Ember ring on your way towards the power station. To the left after reaching the power station you'll find a sphere with a tuft of Phoenix down for you. Now we're going to turn on the power. There are 4 stations around the main one that you need to turn on. Fight your way around and get them turn on to reveal the way forward and to be able to get the other spheres. So with all 4 panels activated you can now back track and get those other spheres. Take the elevator by the 2 bombs and the Pulsework guy. Be ready for a little battle, and there you can activate some stairs take them down and around to another panel and activate it. Take those stairs to find some bombs and a pulsework guy. Take them out to collect Iron Shells from the near by sphere. Now go back to the first set of stairs and go down the ramp. Activate the last panel in this area. There are 3 pulsework guys at the bottom of the stairs. Then collect Vibrant Ooze (X5) from the sphere near by. Now go back to the power station. 
</p> 
<br><p>Now back at the power station there are some things to pick up here. One is a sphere on the inner ring of the station and the other is outside the gates. I suggest using the should you just found for the battle at the gate, other wise the bombs might take you out. Collect 300 gil from the sphere outside the gate and then make your way to the end of the tunnel for a cut scene. 
</p> 
<br><p>There is nothing for you to do at this point, so just follow the prompts and save when asked. Watching all these Cut scenes makes me wonder how freaking big is Cocoon. I mean it's got a freaking ocean? Jeeze! Anyway feel free to explore around but when you're done head into the building and talk to the chick. After that head out to the pier to start the cut scene. 
</p> 
<br>Save if you want. Congrats on beating Chapter 4!!

<br>Gameplay
<br> 
<br><p>Ok so we get to start this chapter with Light and Hope! Ok so take a moment and upgrade your roles, remember all characters gain CP even if they aren't in the party at the time. For Light you'll want to unlock her extra accessory slot in her Medic role and Launch in her Commando role. For Hope let's look at his Synergist role with the idea of getting Barfrost, Barfire and the extra accessory slot there. Create the War and Peace Paradigm for your deck and you are set to move on! 
</p> 
<br>Paradigms for this Chapter are:
<br> 
<br>Burn and Slash-Commando and Ravager
<br>Dual Casting- Ravager and Ravager
<br>War and Peace Commando and Medic
<br>Supersolider Synergist and commando
<br> 
<br><p>Use the save point ahead and follow the lights to an elevator. Activate this and ride it to the next area. You can use the lights that pop up in the middle of the rings as a guide to get to where you're tying to go. Just in case you where wondering at this point you cannot change the party leader. You have to play as Hope for a while. 
</p> 
<br><p>At the top of the elevator there is a save point. Use it if you want then start to follow the lights again to the next elevator. There are a few baddies worth noting at this point. The Vespid has really high HP but isn't really dangerous unless it performs a rare attack called, Flurry of Fire. The Alpha Behemoth is well a behemoth. Try to catch this baddies off guard and stagger it quickly with Burn and slash to about 40% then switch to dualcasting to finish the job. Remember to heal when need. 
</p> 
<br><p>There is a sphere that's guarded by an Alpha Behemoth just before the elevator to the Research Corridor. Take the elevator up to the next level. 
</p> 
<br> 
<br><b>Fun Fact:</b>
<br><p>At the start of  Research Corridor there is a group of 6 Frag Leeches that nets you 156 CP each battle. By riding the near by elevator up and then back down, you can farm CP from them in this manner. 
</p> 
<br><p>Use the save point if you want and if you want farm some of that sweet sweet CP. You can farm nearly thousands in a rather short time just right there! Which may be something you want to do.  Reason being we now have access to Role Level Crystals in the Crystarium. These are special crystals that cost more than others and provide small bonuses for the character when they are using that role.  I suggest first obtaining Role Level crystals for roles used most often, like Commando for Lighting and Medic for Hope.  The others can wait till all other available crystals have been obtained for any given role.  In a separate Guide I will go over the Crystarium.  There will also be a separate guide for weapons and accessories too. 
</p> 
<br><p>My personal CP gathering “Circuit” is to go between the group of 4 Frag Leeches on the Canopy Walkway just before the Alpha Behemoth and the Group of 6 Frag Leeches on Research Corridor. You get 104 CP for the group of 4 and 156 for the group of 6. It's a great way to get a lot of CP fast.  Doing this should allow you to gain all the currently available crystals quickly. 
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so once you've gathered all the cp you' d like here, head on down the Corridor. On the right there is a sphere to grab as you go by, guarded by 2 Vespids and an Alpha Behemoth, other wise just keep fighting your way to the next area.
</p> 
<br><p>There is nothing to pick up in the Bulkhead Fal'Cie area, so use the svae point after the cut scene and use the elevator to go to the next area. Now Bioweapons Research Site D, you MUST defeat all the baddies in order to lower the barriers that block your way. There are some nasty baddies down here on the floor of the forest. 
</p> 
<br><p>You have to beat a bunch of Sliver Lobos in order to bring down the first barrier. These guys can inflect poison, but they are weak to fire. So at this point you might want to make sure that Light knows Fire and Hope knows Fira. These could be handy. Anyway,  Depending on where the health of the enemy you might want to go for the quick kill instead of healing the status. Just use your best judgment. Crawlers are week to fire, so blast them and carry on.  
</p> 
<br><p>Guarded by a group of Crawlers there is a sphere on the right hand side to pick up on your way through. 
</p> 
<br><p>Now here's where you need to be on your guard. The Feral Behemoth is a beast literally.  Start off with Slash and Burn then switch to Dualcasting to quickly stagger the beastie.  Now staggered switch back to slash and burn and make sure to use Light's Launch ability.  This should keep the great beastie from doing more damage especially if you can time it with Hope's attacks to Juggle the creature. (Ed does not guarantee this). 
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>Climb up the path there for you and then beat up a bunch of Crawlers to get to a you guessed it a Cut Scene!! Watch the fun and get ready to start again, this time as Light! Yay!! Now we can use that awesome guy we beat earlier, Odin in battle! I suggest getting familiar with the big guy. Anyway from were you start move forward and jump down. Use the save point if you want and in the alcove on the right collect a sphere with a star pendant in it. 
</p> 
<br><p>Move forward to where Hope is waiting and jump back up to the platform. Watch a Cut scene and just wonder man just wonder. Off to the left guarded by a Barbed Spector is a sphere with Edge Carbine, a new weapon for Lighting. Equip it if you wish and keep on down the trail. At the end of the trail there is a Feral Behemoth to fight. Keep the same pattern as before and you'll do fine. After the battle jump down and save your game. 
</p> 
<br><p>Once you enter Environmental Regulation, and if you look to your left you will see that you can slip through the small gap to the side, to fight another Feral Behemoth and collect a sphere to get 1500 gil. The next sphere in the area is a trip. Once you enter the alcove a Feral Behemoth with his crawler buddies charges you. Take out the weaker crawlers, then heal before taking on the Behemoth.  This time the prize is Fragrant Oil(X8).
</p> 
<br><p>OK after that there is a little battle with 3 Barbed Spectors.  You can take them by surprise. Now after that there is a 3 way battle with a Feral Behemoth and 3 sliver lobos.  You can sneak up on these guys too, and if that's the case then you'll want to take out the big guy first. It's easy to do if you get the drop on him.  OK so you can do two things, one is go up to the next platform via the jump stuff or you can get caught in a trap with a Feral Behemoth and a Barbed Spector. This fight is a bit hard. I suggest if you go this way to take out the Spector first then the Behemoth. Your reward for going into the trap is the Watchman's Amulet. 
</p> 
<br><p>Climb up the leaves and make you're way the guys on the ground. Watch the cut scene and make your way around the funny path. Watch out on the right for a sphere, the last of the area with a Ethersol in it. 
</p> 
<br><p>I suggest saving your game before and after the battle at the end of the path. There is a boss fight coming up, so save! Upgrade your weapons if you want or can and level up your characters roles. 
</p> 
<br>          <b>SAVE YOUR GAME AT THE SAVE POINT! </b>
<br> 
<br>So yeah guess what?! <b>BOSS FIGHT!!!</b>

<br><p>Ok so lets start thanking stars that this isn't a 2 part battle. OK so start out with Supersoldier and let Hope Buff *claps* you up. This allows Light to attack while Hope does all that supportive stuff. Now Symbisos is a good Paradigm to have for this fight too, that way you can heal and have the buffs re-buffed as needed. Now comes the fun. After your buffs are applied and Hope is standing around just looking cute, switch to Slash and Burn. Beat the crap out of the beastie till the stagger guage is about 30 – 40 % full, then switch to Dual casting. YOU NEED TO USE LIBRA, this will allow the characters to auto switch and the beastie changes what it's weak too.  You may one need to do that a couple of times before they get it, but never fear they will.  Ok so use dual casting to stagger the beastie, then switch back to Slash and burn. This beastie is vulnarable to Light's Lunch ability. Use it! This will give you a blissful rest from the attacks. Now cause of this things astronomical hp, you wont get this guy in one stagger, however you can with a little luck get it in two. Heal when you need and re apply buffs as needed. Keep at it! 
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so now we've beat the boss! We get 1000 cp and bragging rights till the next one! Oh and an expansion to our Crystarium. Why don't we use those CP points we just earned?
</p> 
<br><p>Save again if you wish and exit the area.  Watch the cut scene and save if you wish when prompted.  
</p> 
<br>Yay for really long cut scenes. 
<br> 
<br>But we made it to the end of the chapter!!

<br><p>So we start out as Sazh and Vanille. Yay! Use all that CP that we've gained as Light and Hope, then if you wish save your game. (I told you it's a guiding rule) Anyway with Vanille I would work on her Medic level first then Ravager, then Saboteur.  With Sazh work on Ravager and Commando first then Synergist. Synergist gives Sazh an extra accessory slot and with Vanille you want to unlock Cura and Ensuna in her medic role and Poison in her Saboteur role. 
</p> 
<br><p>You want to have the undermine Paradigm with Saboteur role and Ravager, Dualcasting and slash and burn again this time around. Flandragora are immune to physical damage, so be sure to have dualcasting or undermine on hand. The war and peace for healing with a medic and commando or Yin and Yang with A medic and Ravager.  Either works for healing. 
</p> 
<br><p>Now after all that we are ready to move on! Welcome to the Sunleth Waterscape. Isn't it pretty? From the save point just jump across to the next island and keep going like that for a while. If you go to the left after the blue jump rings  you'll find a sphere waiting of the plundering. Grab it and get back to the way you were going. 
</p> 
<br><p>Be on the look out for a sphere in the Sun-dapple trail area, on the left early on it contains the Belladonna wand for Vanille.  On the round about with all the Flandraora there is a sphere, containing a new weapon for Sazh, a pair of zprocyons. Equip these if you wish before moving on.
</p> 
<br><p>If you got to the left and fight a group of Gremlins there is a sphere to collect back there. Watch the cut scene and get ready to be sad. Very sad only. Anyway pick yourself up and dry you eyes, and let's carry on. 
</p> 
<br>Continue down the path, save if you wish or shop or upgrade at the Save point.
<br> 
<br><p>Ok so like the game says, you're going to be facing Scalebeasts. These guys are easy to sneak up on, but they wont take damage till they are staggered so keep that in mind going forward. That being said they do yield 160 CP each time. They are harder to beat, but if you keep your health up and stagger the buggers fast a couple of times they are yours. There is a sphere to the left of where we start after the cut scene that is guarded by a Scalebeast, it's treasure is Iron Shells(X 15). Other than that you can avoid the Scalebeasts unless you just wanna fight them. 
</p> 
<br><p>Pick up the sphere on your way down the trail on the left past the Scalebeasts but before the Gremlins. (Gremlins sound like my ferrets chittering when they're mad at me.) take out the next group of gremlins and collect your sphere. (at this point for me all my character roles were at the Crystarium caps. You may want to think about doing this too, before the end of the chapter)
</p> 
<br><p>Anyway at the big tree there is another cut scene,  apparently we needed some down time. Anyway go look for Sazh! ( I need a moment. *Sniff* Ok let's carry on)
</p> 
<br><p>OK now it starts to get a little weird. Here you get to control the weather, sort of.  At the Save point save again if you wish, and read thought the tutorial the game gives you on the weather control spheres.
</p>
<br><p>So in the rain you will encounter Mud frogs, Hedge Frogs,  and scalebeats. In sunny weather you will encounter Wyverns and Flandragora and in either condition you will meet both Gremlins and Garchimacera.
</p> 
<br><p>So stick with rain for the first orb. At the second switch to dry conditions. Each time you change the conditions you respawn the baddies in the area.  Anyway sticking with rain then dry will pit you against a set of flandragora to get to a treasure sphere instead of a scalebeast. So take the right hand path after the second orb to avoid the Wyvern. It's a nasty beastie that can be a challenge to beat. If you feel up to it or need the CP then go for the battle other wise the Flandragora are a much easier set of critters to take out. Touch the third weather sphere to switch back to rainy.
</p> 
<br><p>If you decide to fight the Wyvern, use Esuna to remove protect from the creature. And be sure to buff up yourself. Keep and eye on your hp and just hit it till it staggers then hit it some more.
</p> 
<br><p>By pass the Scalebeast, if you want or take it out, up to you. Once inside what seems to be a cave go to the left and switch to dry conditions again. This time it's easier to fight the Flandragora again than a scalebeast. Collect the sphere neary by and carry on after switching back to rain. Alright! The control by the scalebeast is the last one. You might want to switch it back to dry before moving on.  Save at the save point and if you haven't hit the level caps for your roles yet, you might want to think about grinding till you do. Either way get ready for this chapter's boss fight.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>A little set up before hand. Have tide turner in your Paradigm deck.( Synergist And Saboteur) Make regular use of War and Peace in the up coming fight or you may not make it. You also what Dual casting in your deck. So your Paradigm deck should be Tide Turner, Dualcasting, Slash and Burn, and War and Peace.
</p> 
<br><p>Also having your Crystarium maxed out for this point in the game is a great way to make sure you have all the abilities needed to beat these guys. OK preparations are complete, here we go.

<br><b>Boss fight

<br><p>OK so start with Tide Turner. Debuff Enlil and let Sazh cast his protective spells on the party. It might be a good idea to choose the abilities you want to cast as Saboteur, You want deportect, deshell and poison on Enlil and you don't want auto-hinder to change targets on you with out warning.
</p> 
<br><p>USE LIBRA OR LIBASCOPE! These guys have weaknesses. Enki is weak to Lighting and immune to water and Enlil is weak to water but Immune to lighting. So keep that in mind!
</p> 
<br><p>Now that we have our buffs and debuffs in place lets start kicking some butt. Use Slash and Burn to bump the stagger gauge on Enlil to about 40%. Once there switch to Dual casting to stagger the beastie quickly. Once Enlil performs bellow be ready for things to get harder.
</p> 
<br><p>Bellow bestows a bunch of buffs on Enlil that make things just a bit harder of you. It also means an attack called Raging Tempest. You should be able to stop this with him on screen and by attacking him before he can preform the attack. Keep healing and don't worry, he'll fall.
</p> 
<br><p>Enraged is an attack that will more or less claw you. Both creatures preform this attack. Both will preform Bellow too. The buffs are the same for each creature. Enki goes down easier than his friend.
</p> 
<br><p>You get 1000 cp and an Crystarium expansion after the battle. Take a moment it upgrade what you can and get ready to move on.

<br> 
<br><p>Alright we are back and ready to kick some PSICOM and Corps booty! Take a moment and check out the Crystarium, level up where you can. Since Light will be spending a bit of time this chapter as a Ravager, try to unlock Thundara and Blizard after that Smite in her Commando role. Unlock Watera and Thundara for Hope then work on Medic then Synergist
</p> 
<br><p> If you take the hook near the tunnel entrance you'll find a sphere hiding behind some trucks in the area. Alright once in the tunnel grab the sphere on the left. 
</p> 
<br><p>Once you get into the big tunnel that Hope was talking about turn around an pick up a sphere. Ok so this is where things can get a little funny. There are some spheres around there that can be hard to get. For those of you like me who have to get them all, I'm going to give instructions. If you don't want to get these spheres for whatever reason, just skip ahead. 
</p> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br><p> OK run to the end of the thing and use the what's it here to call a who's it. You got that? No? ok. At the end of the platform use the device to call the floating detached platform to you. Now ride the sweet ride that's really slow to it destination, then get off. Ok after disembarking the floating disc,  activate the thing on the left and get back on the disc. This will take you to a location with 2 spheres. OK once back to the second dock, move around the catwalk(I'm too sexy for this guide) to find a set of Flanitors. These are more annoyance that threat, but the other guy that looks like a Scalebeast, Lucidon, is  a pain.  Alternate between Slash and burn and war and peace to keep your health up and once the stagger gauge hits about 40% switch to dualcasting to finish the job.  This baddie can be Launched once staggered. 
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so at the end of the Catwalk there is another dock, activate the one on the left to be taken to an area with spheres,  a Lucidon and  a Flanitor.  Get the jump of these baddies to get off to a good start. So collect your goodies and head back to the second dock again. This time activate the thing on the right to move on.
</p>Or as was my case just get back on the fly disc.
<br> 
<br><p>Move along now pond to the cut scene that awaits you beyond the Lucidon. Once it's over keep going down the cat walk, pick up the sphere along the way and watch a cut scene. Fight or run from the annoying Flanitors and jump on the dics at the end of the catwalk. Use the save point if you wish and use the elevator at the end of the catwalk, yeah the catwalk. Watch yet another cut scene before going up.
</p> 
<br><p>We pick up play as Snow. Yay! Thing of all the awesome we can be now! Sort of if you like Snow's butt saving kind of awesome. Anyway we get to finally fight with our Shiva summons! Way to go! WE only got the thing in like chapter 3! Good grief. Ok so take out the Orion first, then get the small fish.
</p><p>Ok so short cut scene and then use all that CP in the crystaruim on Snow! You should be able to completely buy all available crystals for at lest 2 of his 3 roles, Sentinel, Commando and Ravager. Sentinel has an accessory slot near the role level crystal. So use the cp you have and work on the final role as you go. Be sure to create the Dual casting paradigm and supersolider, then feel free to save and move forward.
</p><p>Fight your way through a bunch of troops, up the ice path thing and around the terrace. There is a sphere at the end to pick up. However the thing is guarded by 2 Corps Pacifix and a PSICOM Warlord. Collect the sphere if you wish other wise use the blue ring to jump out on to the ice path thing. If you go to the right after getting off the ice bridge there is a sphere at the end of the platform, guarded by some guys. Beat them up if you want the sphere other wise, got to the left and carry on with your trek around the Terrace.   After you jump down into the tunnel there is a sphere behind you. Grab it and then keep going right down the tunnel.
</p>Use the save point if you wish. Jump down from here into another tunnel, then watch the cut scene.
<br> 
<br><p>Ok now who are we? Someone totally new! It's Fang! Use the Crystarium and all that fun stuff. Make sure you have War and Peace and Divide and Conquer(saboteur and Commando). The big buys for Fang are Launch, Smite and Adernaline in her commando role and Slowaga and accessory crystal in her Saboteur role. Use the rest as you see fit. After that fight and be awesome! Then watch a shocking cut scene. 
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so now we're back and Snow and Hope. Cp Crystarium, you know the drill at this point right? There is a sphere behind you to grab, other wise save if you wish and  move on. Fight or flee as you see fit. There is a tricky sphere to get here. Just past the first corner there is a little place were you can jump up on to catwalk, at the end of which is a sphere. Ok so once you get that jump back down and keep going around. There are several places were you could avoid a battle however you may want the cp, so it's up to you which route you take through the city. By the next save point there is a sphere, use the save station if you wish, and fight through the barriers.
</p> 
<br><p>Keep going till you hit a cut scene. Fight the PSICOM guys that drop in on you and keep moving toward the markers on the map. Oh look now we're on a roof. Use the handy dandy save point, and keep moving forward fighting your way through the baddies. After you jump down into the tunnel like area there is a sphere behind where you land. Be careful here there is a ninja falco Velocycle. As you go around the area there is an off shoot with a sphere. Then behind the billboards. Head towards the markers on the map, fighting of fleeing as you see fit,. Grab the sphere on your way, sitting in the open on the right, watch out for another ninja Falco Velocycle.  At the top of the jumps there is another sphere all the way around, out run the snipers or fight them as you wish. You might want to use a shroud here to keep yourself hidden or to get the jump on the baddies as needed. If you can get the jump on the Velocycle and sniper you stand a good chance of knocking them out before they get you. Keep going along the rails and metal walk ways to the next save point.  There is a nasty little battle before the save point with a Velocyle and 2 snipers. Do what you need to take them out and move on.  I strongly suggest saving your game if you haven't already.  You want to make sure that all ability roles are covered in your Crystarium for both Snow an Hope that this point. It's important.

<br><p>This beasties Tail Hammer is a nasty piece of work. It can hit the party for massive damage. For this reason you never should let either party memebers heath fall below about half. Other wise you are done for. Use Supersolider to buff the party to the gills and  then switch to slash and burn. Hit the beastie till the stagger guage is about 1/3 full then shift to Dualcasting to kick major but and stagger the creature. Heal as needed to stay alive. Repeat steps 1-3 as needed to complete boss fight.
</p> 
<br><p>Once it flies off, and a cut scene and a save prompt later,  we find ourselves and Fang and Light again. Yay!! Ladies!! Anyway use the CP on them in the Cyrstarium.
</p> 
<br><p>Note: You need to take out Orion and Lodestar when you encounter them, they are the big bads of this area. Remember to use Slow against these guys and others to keep your party on the winning side.
</p> 
<br><p>OK so from the starting point go back, there is a sphere to plunder. Jump up the funny ladders and then save again if you want. Head towards and beat the group of Soldiers. Do you know where we are yet? There was a save point by the Lodestar Behemoth. You can out run the big guy, but he offers 128 Cp, so he might be worth the fight. Use slow to get the upper hand heal when needed. If you choose not to fight the big bad beastie that's fine.
</p> 
<br><p>In order to open the sphere on the way to Felix Heights you must defeat the baddies near by. Head towards the marker on the map, and watch the cut scene. Afterwards save if you want and keep going along your way. You can in theory follow Light straight though the baddies to the next save point if you wish. Take this time to gather any CP you may need and fill your Tp gauge if needed. There are 2 spheres in the area that you can collect if you wish, they are at opposite ends of the garden.
</p><p>Either way save at the save point and get ready for a fight. You can either fight or boogey past the Behemoth and little dude, totally up to you.

<br><p>Ok this is easy enough at first. As Hope use Libra, the stand by looking cute for your HP to be drained away. The real fight doesn't start till Light and Fang walk in. Evened odds is a good paradigm to start with. Let Hope buff the party while Fang slows down the baddie and let Light heal. If you're looking for the fast track then switch to Relentless Assault, healing when needed. If you want a more sure way for a first time win switch back and forth between Delta attack and Solidarity. Both of which have Medics in the party. It can take a bit to stagger the bugger but hit him hard once you do. You may have to stagger him a few times to beat him.
</p> 
<br><p>After the batter you get a cut scene and a nice reward. You got a Shield Talisman, that grants the wearer protect status at the start of each battle. Nice right? Equip this one either your partor Hope. Now go up the stairs and grab the sphere as you go by and meet up with Hope and the gang. Now watch a cut scene. A very awkward cut scene. Save your game when you have control again. Use your cp where you can then maybe take a look around the house. In several rooms you look into you can see the other characters, like Light standing by as Snow rests and Hope and his father in the living room. Turn on the tv to continue with the story.  But man! That is a big apartment! So watch the cut scene and  get ready for a fight afterwards. Make your way to the back of the house to find a sphere. There is also a sphere in the corner of the living room. Ok make your way to the marker on this map, and watch yet another cut scene.

<br><p>First thing here switch to Evened odds and let Hope buff up the party. Ok once everyone has at least shell and protect, then you can start taking out the 4 parts of the tank before attacking the main part. As each of the little parts explode, it knocks a chunk of hp off the tank. Switch between Delta attack and Solidarity to slowly but surely take this thing out. Towards the end this mech gets a stagger % of 200. Stagger the tank and take names. For the fight you get access to a new shop, an expansion in the Crystarium and 1800 CP.  Watch the cut scene and save when prompted if you wish.

<br> 
<br><b>Game Play:</b>
<br>
<br>
<br><p>So here we are a Vanille and Sazh again. There aren't any spheres in the first area to grab so just move towards the markers on the maps. Watch the Cut scene. From where we start go down the path and take a right.  After the next cut scene move on into the park, there is a save point near by if you wish to use it. And at some point in all of this use the CP you've earned in the Crystarium. Try aiming for Renew and/or raise with Vanille's medic and unlock Haste in Sazh's Synergist. Now take the first pod you come to and travel to the Park proper.
</p> 
<br><p>There are a few spheres in the area to get. At the end of the very last arrival thing there is a sphere by a chocobo to grab before moving on. Here you get to hunt down the Chick, check the group of sheep looking things dead in front of you first, then the toy stand, then over the fountain in the tower thing, then in a group of chocobos. If you mange to hunt down the little bugger you get a sphere. Yay for us!
</p> 
<br><p>Anyway keep going past the save point towards the Mall and the next map marker. Oh look a cut scene. As you zig and zag around the area there are 3 spheres to pick up. One along the way and the 2, one to the far ends of the paths near the save point.
</p> 
<br>Side note:
<br><p>there is a group of Zweg Metrodroids around a sphere, in the Clock Tower area. You can take these for about 640CP a pop. If you want to make these re-spawn, all you have to do is run back back and forth between the mall area sphere and run back.

<br><p>OK so start Use Libra on this guy to find his weakness.  Then cast Haste, faith, bravery and Enfrost on the party, and let Vanille hinder the guy. Use Dual casting and slash and burn to stagger the mech quickly. Heal when needed and just kick basic butt. This guy's got an attack called Nerve Gas that inflicts poison but this isn't a big deal.
</p><p>After the battle you get your 1500 cp and motherlode., but right after you get thrown into and Eidolon battle. So yeah, anyway, after the cut scene follow Vanille. Watch yet another cut scene then get ready to fight another Eidolon.
</p> 
<br><b>Eidolon Battle- Brynhildr</b>
<br><p>Keep with Tide turner in this one too, and be sure to have Haste and Vigilance always on your characters. Remember Haste then Vigilance in that order at all times.  Ok now switch to War and Peace to heal cause you probably will need to at this point and then use Dualcasting to drive the Eidolon's chain gauge. Switch as needed between the two to get this guy under control in about 2 to 3 minutes. Good Luck! Hit square as soon as it comes on the screen and you've got yourself another summons. Sazh gets another ATB gauge segment.
</p> 
<br>Watch the cut scene and save when prompted.

<br><b>Gameplay:</b>
<br> 
<br><p>We are back with the 4 musketeers and ready to kick butt. Use the CP and all that jazz. Since Light will be a Ravager for most of the level you might want to unlock Areo and the Watera in her cyrstarium. Then Renew and Raise for her. Same with Hope, Renew first then the others. For Fang work on getting to steelguard in the sentinel role, the curse and cursaga in Saboteur. Save if you want and then talk to Rygdea at the marker.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so fun on a bun and all that stuff, watch the cut scene, and move on with the story. (I'm just glad I don't have to fly anything)OK so now we are in the heart of the baddies turf and we have to fight our way through! Save often here guys!
</p> 
<br><p>Make sure you have the Diversity Paradigm going forward. Bully is another good one and Relentless Assault is nice.
</p> 
<br><p>After jumping all that way, use the thing to call the window washing platform like thing. Ride that up and then jump the rest of the way. Once you land turn around and grab a sphere. Ok so after we get outside yet again turn around cause there is  sphere past two Deckdrones waiting for you. After jumping across the ships, behind you is another sphere. Yet again after jumping up the ship there is another sphere behind your landing point to collect.
</p> 
<br><p><b>Side Note:</b> The External Berths and the Crew Corridors are great places to farm CP. The Deckdrones drop Digital Circuits and Silicone Oil, these are great for upgrading your accessories and weapons. As an addes bonus each Deckdrone drops 141 cp.  Once and a while the Dragoons will drop an Incentive Chip, this little thing has a value of 2500 gil. Inside the ship the baddies here can be farmed for CP and Credit Chips worth 500 gil apiece and occasionally the rare Incentive Chip. To re-spawn these baddies just hop the line between map sections.
</p> 
<br><p>Once in the Crew Corridor take the first right and there is a sphere waiting for you there. Fun little fact if you go to the end of the first hall you come to after coming back inside, you end up in a little alcove with a few baddies and a save point. Ok so taking that right, we travel around fighting as we go, grab the sphere as you go by.  You can juggle the Viking in the way with a little bit of good timing and come on that just too fun to do.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so be careful not to just run past the next save point. Use it if you wish then keep on fighting your way down the hall. Remember you can farm vast amounts of CP and other spoils if you wish or need to in the External Berths and the Crew Corridor.  
</p> 
<br><p>So pick up the sphere on your way to the mark at the end of the hall here. Now watch the cut scene and get ready to have a little bit of fun. Back as Sazh and Vanille, at the end of the left hall there is a sphere. Grab the goodies by the marker and keep going!
</p> 
<br>Wasn't that fun?
<br>
<br>
<br><p>Ok so we pick up again with the others. Spend some CP if you can and save at the save point.  Now we find ourselves in a round area. There are 2 spheres on the center circle and 2 at opposite ends of the room. Alright so gather your goodies and fight your way around the circles if you wish. It's worth noting here that you will want Fang to know the Curse ability soon, so work on getting that if you don't have it already.
</p> 
<br><p>OK back as Sazh and Vanille. About half way around the outer circle there is a sphere guarded by a few flans. Take them out and gather you goodies. Remember to us your CP and gather the crystals you can. Take the second right  to get the other goodie in the area. There are some rather strong baddies for a 2 man team, but this path is the path of lest resistance so to speak.  Take out the Vespid first then move on to the big guy next. Heal when you need to and just dig in.
</p> 
<br><p>Now we're going to jump back to Light and the l'ce Gang. CP, Crystarium, ect. I suggest that after getting Curse and Cusaga for Fang focus on any HP crystals that you can buy.  You'll want it later.  Right now behind the start point is a sphere to grab, but there also be baddies that way.  Take out the Vespid Soliders first then the Viking. OK so from the save point make your way through the flap things. At the next part of this area there is a little open air maze like thing. There is  sphere to grab off to the far right side. Just pan the camera over to the side and you can't miss it.
</p> 
<br><p>Take out the Dragoons first then the Vikings, healing if needed. After the save point at a walk down the wall right there and grab the sphere at the end of the path. Ok there is a a sphere here that can be hard to pick up. To get this one ride the funny ramp down to the bottom level then go around to where the sphere is. Grab it and go back. Now after that there is another in the far right corner guarded by Dragoons.  So you can just move towards the marker or you can get all that CP from the baddies in the area, either is fine. Just try to get all the skill crystals you can.

<br><p>Soon as the battle starts inflict Curse and slow on this guy using the bully paradigm. Once that's done and you have a few buffs of your own, switch to Relentless Assault, switching to diversity to heal to stagger the beastie. This should be too easy, and you should know why by now right?

<br><p>Like before hit the flying freak with Curse and Slow fast as you can, then with Buffs of your own in place switch to Relentless Assault with the occasionally switch to Diversity to heal. This time around the beast makes frequent use of an attack called, Hellstorm Blot. This can drain anywhere from 1/3 to ½ of any party members hp, so keep on that healing! Renew comes in handy here and if you need to summon Odin to help out.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok if you did this well you'll have ending this battle in about 5 minuets. Watch the cut scene and ooh pretty.
</p> 
<br>Ok so <b>SAVE!</b> Use your cp all that fun stuff. Ok now to navigate this mess ahead.
<br><p>There are quite a few spheres to get here. To start activate the thing off to the side to call stairs! Yay stairs!  Take out the punks at the bottom and activate the back left thing, then grab the sphere there. Now activate the thing in the back  on this platform.  Run up the newly called ramp and grab the sphere. Go back and activate the back right thing to get to the next platform. Beat the baddies here and then activate the thing in the back to call the ramp and get another sphere. From here you can just go straight forward using the call things to call the ramps. There is a sphere on the next platform down.  From here you can either go down one and across or go across and go down. Across and down has only one battle where the other way has two or you could go back to the first platform and go to the left then straight down like here. There is a sphere on the third platform. Be sure to keep an eye on your health through this area. It can be tough. That being said you want to be close as you can to the role level crystals as you can. So try gather the CP you need from this area. Now from that third sphere make your way to the end of the line, there is a sphere waiting for you on each side of the room.  There is a final sphere on your way out.
</p> 
<br><p>Now you want to do a few things before moving on. One is to make Hero's Charge Paradigm, (Medic+Commando+synergist) Equip the gold bangle on Hope, the weakest link at this point and then equip two tungsten bangles on Light. Really though you want to be really close to those role level crystals or have bought them already. This area is great to get insane amounts of CP. I highly suggest getting all the currently available crystals you can for each active party member.

<br><p>Ok this guy comes with his own choir attached… Creepy. So this will be fun at least. OK so to defeat this guy you have to take out his creepy singing buddies first. Start by switching to the Bully Paradigm to debuff and buff. Then Diversity to keep the girls fighting and Hope healing. Each of the singing heads is weak to something, so use that to stagger them quickly. Either use Libra/ Libra scope or just manually target them with the spells till the AI catches on.
</p> 
<br>Left Pauldron- Lighting
<br>Left Ailette- Fire
<br>Right Pauldron -Ice
<br>Right Ailette –Water
<br> 
<br><p>Once the creepy choir is gone then you can start wailing on Barthandelus. At once use Bully to buff and debuff, then use either relentless Assault or Diversity to kick butt. Barthandelus will stagger at 250% now that his creepy singing buddies are singing from the after life. Remember you have Odin if needed and if Bart here casts Doom on Light no worries you should have plently of time to beat him to a pulp.
</p> 
<br><p>OK so for winning we get 6000 CP an expansion to the Crystarium and an Entite Ring.  Watch the cut scenes here and then RUN like the Doctor has your hand!

<br><b>Game Play:</b>
<br> 
<br><p>Save when prompted, watch the cut scene.  Talk to the others if you wish or just run to the marker on the map. After a shot cut scene you're in control again. Follow the other members of your party up the stairs.  After a fight we get the nifty spiffy ability to choose our party and to take on all roles with each character! Just amazing! Right? Anyway  now that we  get to choose our parties, it's time to choose the right team for the job. I suggest that you keep with Light, since she's awesome and Fang cause she's strong,z and Hope cause he has the strongest magic at the moment. You can sub Sazh for Hope but honestly right now stick to what we know works right? But that's me. Use who you wish, remember to use all that cp we just got or hold on to it.
</p> 
<br><p>OK just a heads up it takes and insane amount of Cp to teach a character a new role. Like some 9000 cp just to get to the first skill so they can be that role in battle. At this point it would be best to keep working on the current roles we have been and only when you've gotten all the crystals you can for each of our developed roles then start working on learning new ones.
</p> 
<br>That being said you really want to have these Paradigm.
<br>Relentless Assault= Ravager+ ravager+ Commando
<br>Diversity=Ravager+commando+Medic
<br>Delta Attack=Commando+Sentinel+ravager
<br>Soildarity=Commando+Snetinel+Medic
<br>Protection=Medic+Sentienl+Synergist
<br>Evened odds= Medic+Sabotuer+Synergist
<br> 
<br><p>Right then Pulsework knights aren't hard to throw down. They are weak to fire and thunder so use them.  Right off there is a sphere being guarded by Pulsework Knights. Take them out an collect your goodies.  
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so now is the time to be thinking about some grinding. Things are just gonna get harder from here and this place is a prime location to gather a bunch of cp and components. Ther Knights are worth 256 PC each and the Circutirons are easy to kill but drop Bomb shell once and a while. The Noctilucale are great in big groups. There is a group of 10 near a sphere that is really easy to get the jump on and they yield 640 CP each time you win.
</p> 
<br><p>Back to our story. Move towards the marker on the map. There will come a point when you can either go forward or back track to the other side of a fence with a couple of Circutirons and a sphere. Once past the second save point you'll encounter Phosphoric Ooze. If you see these start to merge attack them! Don't wait for them to become a big bad! Ok so once at the bottom of the stairs behind you at the dead end is a sphere to collect. Then going right across then the jump circle  on the right to  the  dead end where a sphere is waiting to be looted. Note these are the Noctilucale group of 10 is located.
</p> 
<br><p>Once you've gathered you fill of Cp and the sphere, jump off to the left this time. At the intersection got ot he right to collect a sphere then head towards the save point. Save if you've done a bunch of leveling, or if you just like to have saves, then make your way to the door.
</p> 
<br><p>OK so this is a really big place and we see some new takes on old friends here. On the second level down there is a sphere to collect, I just jumped down to it while exploring. Once you've gathered your cp and sphere here, make  your way to the 3 level down and go through the door, save if you want and check you Crystarium see if there's another role you'd like someone to fill or get all the available crystals you can.
</p> 
<br><p>There are a couple of nasty beasties ahead here so be ready. You can and should get the jump on these guys. Berserkers aren't the hardest things to beat in the game, but they sure look scary and to an underdeveloped party could prove fatal. They aren't hard to stagger, and they can be launched. I do love to juggle the baddies, so try to time you shots to be just after Fang's. or who ever is your commando. On your way out of the room grab  the sphere and then take the elevator down. Use the save point if you wish and move on with your gaming self.  To the right of the save point in a dead end is a sphere to collect, you can literally get the jump on the Imps guarding it.
</p> 
<br><p>From here head down the hall, becareful going around the turn there is a Behemoth waiting for you. You can attack it from behind to get off on the right foot for battle. Around the next corner is a sphere to collect as you go by.  Don't for get about spending your CP!
</p> 
<br><p>Past the sphere and up is another group of 10 Noctilucale, and beyond that a harder fight with a few Noctilucale and a Greater Behemoth. There is a sphere to get behind them.  For some reason you can't just jump down to the area you need to be in, but you have to go back to where you picked up the first sphere here. Then head down the stairs and around to the other side. There are 2 Behemoths at the bottom of the slope so be careful. Let the first one chase you to the top of the slope. Be quick or it will get you, just as it turns to leave, jump back behind it and catch it off guard. You can juggle these monsters, just in case you were wondering. The next one has some buddies, this can be a tough one. Keep an eye on your health and you'll do fine. Gab the sphere by the save point and the one that's guarded by a group of Imps. Use the save point, shop upgrade your weapons or buy stuff, spend CP and all that fun stuff. Try to get to the caps in the more evolved roles you have. Then work on the others.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so heading to the marker did you notice anything strange? Like a guy waiting on you? Well we've got a Boss fight coming up!
</p> 
<br> 
<br><b>Boss Fight
<br> 
<br></b><table class="content_infotable"><tr><td class="content_headerrow" colspan=5>Cid Raines</b>
</td></tr><tr><td class="content_headerrow">HP: 226800
</td></tr><tr><td class="content_headerrow">MA:172

</td></tr><br><tr><td class="content_headerrow">CP:6000
</td></tr><br> 
<br><p>OK this is a sort of two part battle. In the first part Cid will mostly spell out what he's gonna do. Look for the following text on the screen as you fight Cid.
</p> 
<br>Offensive Shift-Cid will be attacking with both magic and physical attacks like Launch.
<br> 
<br>Defensive Shift-Cid Guards against damage but you can still build the stagger gauges
<br> 
<br>Recovery Shift- Cid is going to take a moment to heal and remove status aliments.
<br> 
<br><p>So Cid is susceptible to slow and curse. So use Evened Odds to debuff and buff. You want to have at least Shell and protect on the party at this point. Switch to Delta Attack while Cid in on the Offensive. Use Relentless Assault when he's in Defensive mode. Keep an eye on your health and be sure to make use of the sentinel role when needed, and keep those buffs up! Once the stagger gauge gets to about 60% you may want to be in Delta Attack from here on out when Cid isn't in Guard mode.
</p> 
<br><p>The reason being is that any time before the first stagger Cid will use his Metamorphose ability and start the second phase of this battle. He will use an attack called Seraphic Ray that will severely reduce all party members health- even with a sentinel to protect the others. Switch to Solidarity to heal as soon as you can.  Cid will use this attack randomly through the rest of the battle.
</p> 
<br><p>Now Cid is susceptible to Launch, and you know how I loke to juggle baddies, so yeah try to stagger your attacks with the others in your party to keep him in the air as long as possible. Keeping him in the air reduces the amount of damage he can do and increases the damage you can do to him. 
</p> 
<br><p>With the first stagger over, Cid will revert to his 3 modes, but he wont tell you what he's doing when. At some point he may start throwing status aliments at you and buffing himself up. Keep your guard up and your health high and you should do fine.
</p> 
<br><p>Now you could get uber lucky like I did and only have the first part of the battle happen. I had gotten all the available crystals for the roles that we've been working on to that point. So I had maxed out Light's Ravager, Commando and Medic roles, Fang's Commando, Saboteur, and Sentinel roles and Hope's Ravager, Synergist and Medic roles. Then I just buffed and debuffed as normal, but the first time I played I went though the 2 stages and all that mess, so both is possible.
</p> 
<br><p>For winning you get an expansion to the Crystarium, access to the Moogelworks shop and Tetradic Crown accessory.
</p> 
<br>After the fight use the save point in front of the elevator, then ride it to the next level.
<br> 
<br><p>Alright fight your way to the bottom of the cavern, then take the door to the round rooms. After a brief cut scene, fight or run either works to the next door in the round room, again as before fight or run to the next door. Pick up the sphere on the right as  you go through the cross roads. Make your way across the bridge in the next room and then keep going through the round rooms again, fighting or running as you see fit or can. There is a dead end round room with a sphere and a Berserker fight beydon the room with the Behemoth, 2 Skata`ne and Sitkini. Take out the Sitkini and the Skata`ne first the the Behemoth.  You can run around these guys if you want to just head right to the marker on the map.  Use the save point if you wish and then activate the elevator. Once on the elevator there will be a battle with a 2 Skata`ne and Stikini.  Once off the elevator and through the door there will be a battle with a Berserker, you can get the jump on the Berserker if you're fast enough. After the battle use the save point if you want and go through the door. Make your way across the bridge in the next room. At the cross roads behind the next door there is a sphere in the long arm of the room.  Go forward from there through the next dorr and get ready to fight another  Berserker or 2 in this case. So beat these guys up if you want (one at a time) then open the next door. Get ready for a Eidolon Fight!
</p> 
<br><b>Eidolon Battle: Bahamut</b>
<br> 
<br><p>You will have to fight as Fang in this battle with Vanille and Lighting backing you up. You need to switch to Combat Clinic and use Auto-cover right off. Bahamut will thrash the party at the start and it may look bad, but don't worry. When the Doom counter hits around 1000 or so OR when the party has green health bars, you should be in good shape to start attacking back. Shift to Delta Attack at this point and let Light and Vanille drive up the Gestalt gauge. Switch to Matador to cast debuffs on Bahamut to help increase your chances. If any party members health falls below 50% switch to Combat Clinic right away and heal. Then once everyone is healed repeat your attack pattern. Bahamut should be ready to yield with  the Doom counter around 300 or so.
</p> 
<br><p>After beating this guy, Fang gets an extra ATB gauge segment, we get to watch a cut scene and Fang can now summon Bahamut! Woot!!
</p>
<br>Save when prompted and Congrats! We only and a couple more chapters to go!

<br><p>So this is a BIG area. So to make things easier I've decided to divide this part into the different area sections.  Each one has it's own set of critters to fight and things to do and stuff to collect. I'll list all of that like before but by the section to make this easier to write.

<br>Partisan
<br> 
<br><b>Game play</b>
<br> 
<br>So really long cut scenes but they are pretty. Save if it suits you.
<br> 
<br><p>So we need to go find Hope. There isn't much to do at this point, so run along the path towards the marker fighting the critters along the way and collecting loot. There is a sphere along the path that has the Partisan in it.
</p> 
<br>So first thing off the new Chapter on Pulse is an Eidolon Battle. This time with Alexander.
<br> 
<br>Eidolon Battle- Alexander
<br> 
<br><p>In this fight we are Hope, Light and Fang. We get to control Hope for this one too, since it's his summons we're fighting here.  You'll want to have a Sentinel for most of this fight, due to the fact that Alex likes to dish out poundings.
</p> 
<br><p>Shift to Delta Attack the moment the battle starts. Then go on the offensive. If anyone's HP falls below 50% switch to Combat Clinic to heal. Once everyone is healed switch back to Delta Attack and hit Alex with all you've got again.  When the Doom counter hits around 300 again Alex should be ready to yield.
</p> 
<br>Butt kicked yes? Cool! Big guy is now Hope's summon and he gets an ATB gauge too! Yay!!
<br> 
<br><p>Now remember to keep working on that fancy Sphere Grid I mean Cyrstarium. Spending Cp as you can.  There will be certain skills or spells you'll want to have.

<br> 
<br><p>Heads up there are things here that eat things like us right now for Second Breakfast. I've marked which you can totally fight and win, ones you might fight and win, and ones that will own you like a noob. So keep that in mind. Also we don't have a run away command but we do have “retry” if you by chance get into a battle you aren't ready to handle.

<br> 
<br><p>They are scattered all over this part of Gran Pulse, I can give general directions but the finding is up to  you. Here's a list of the goodies in the area.
</p> 
<br><b>Game play:</b>
<br> 
<br><p>Ok so we are now introduced to Missions or hunts more like it.  Cie'th stones are wel all over. I'll point them out as we go.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>The first one is right there, you can't miss it. The Ectopudding isn't to far just look for the mark on your map. The thing is weak to Lighting and staggers at 600%. For defeating the other guys mark you get an Enegry Sash and the rank of Good Samaritan. Yay us!
</p> 
<br><p>The next Cie'th stone pops up just in front of you. Touch it to get the next mark.  Again this beastie isn't that far from where we are so let's go take it out and help this guy rest. Now if you'd like to put these off till later in the game you can do that too, you have the option later on of coming back here to level and do the odd side quest. But I figure we're here so we might as well right?
</p> 
<br><p>Uridimmu has lackies. Take them out but keep and eye on your health. You'll get Cobaltite for your troubles. The next stone pops up not far from where we are standing again. There are only a few of these we can do at this point, and so of those require we go into the rather dangerous Yaschas Massif area, so I would put those off for a while if I were you. Now lets move on with the story shall we?
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>Let's run around a bit an gather some CP and other stuff. Be mindful of the critters that are around you don't want to get caught in a fight you can't handle yet. On your way towards the Mark on the map and the next area there is the option for a 3 way fight between a Behemoth King and Megistitberian, I would get in on this action. Reason being is that they have knocked each others health to about half, and you get the preemptive strike on them as well. TAKE OUT THE BEHEMOTH BEFORE IT STANDS UP! Other wise you are gonna be ice skating up hill. So kick butts and take names here. This battle if won yields 6600 CP each time. So you might want to swing around a few times and farm a little.
</p> 
<br>Never fear well be back this way for all those thing we missed or aren't ready for

<br>*Only available after defeating the Juggernaut.
<br> 
<br> 
<br><p>Ok so first off we come to a save point. I suggest saving a game here. Pick up the sphere along the way. Hoplites aren't too hard to beat and they are weak to lighting.
</p><p>Keep going along towards the marker. Later when we're stronger, we can come back for the sphere that the Juggernaut is guarding so sneakily at the end of the path. However there are several groups of easy to beat baddies, but look out for Cryohedrons Self-destruct. I ran there and before I got back I had like 25690 cp!
</p> 
<br><p>If you're not up to that challenge yet, just go on past. The Boxed Phalanx can be a beast to beat, and since preemptive strike isn't possible, you can out run them or you can use Odin to beat the mech into submission. If you don't have enough TP to call Odin, you can back track and fight some Hoplites till you do.  Once you're ready switch to relentless Assault before battle and attack the larger guy right off. As soon as Light is in danger of dying summon Odin and kick wholesale butt. The mech should be staggered before you enter Gestalt mode and should fall before Odin leaves the party. Once the Phalanx is gone that only leaves the Hoplites and those should fall easily to the newly healed party.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>So moving on past the save point, the baddies get stronger. But you can beat ‘em! The Cryohedrons aren't a cake walk unless you can surprise them, if you can't surprise them, you might be leaving yourself open to their Self-Destruct ability, that can be very disastrous to the party. Rust puddings are like any Flan baddie and will fall to chains of magic and thankfully don't have the ability to merge with their fellow flan. After the save point there are two off shoots on the left hidden by doors that open as you get closer, that house spheres to be plundered. Gather them if you wish, and keep moving on.
</p> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br><p>After crossing the 1st bridge, if you go down and round instead of up you can grab a sphere. Don't worry about the Fal'cie running around. He's mostly harmless. Gather your goodies and then head up the ramp right beside the bridge. At the 2nd bridge there will be a few Hoplites and a Boxed Phalanx. You cannot run around this fight. You have to beat them to keep going. Like before use relentless assault until the mech staggers then if needed summon Odin. You can use shrouds to buff your party up and to even get a preemptive strike against these guys. Beat them up and keep moving on, the Rust Pudding after that battle should be a piece of cake. Grab the sphere on your way by.
</p> 
<br><b>SIDE NOTE:</b>
<br><p>The first area Maw of the Abyss, is a great place to level up and gain Cp. Plus there's that 3 way battle outside you can get in on as well. So with crystals costing  a fortune, you can either skip the off shoots or you can fight a lot of baddies and gain the needed cp. Some of the off shoots are in fact really good skills to know, so think about it and weight the choices. This entire time you need to be working on Vanille's Medic. This will be important later on.
</p> 
<br><p>You need to get as close as you can to maxing out Vanille's Medic role at this point. You really want Curasa and the ATB gauge segment crystals. Equip Vanille with the Healer's staff, Blessed Talisman and Shield Talisman. This will boost her healing skills and give her some added protection. Use the save point right at the start of the Flowered-filled fissure, and prepare for an Eidolon battle.
</p> 
<br><b>Eidolon Battle- Hecatonchoir</b>
<br> 
<br><p>This guy fights the same thought the entire battle. After standing idle with the text Looming Wrath for a while, he will launch into a furious combo attack, before repeating the same 2 moves again over and over.
</p><p>So here's what you do, get a sentinel in place to bear the brunt of the attack. You want to have the Sentinel out there and ready to take the burden of right off. If you don't have this set up it's like to be a short battle. Ok so here's the deal wait until Fang runs over and hits the Eidolon for the second time, then with the distance between her and Vanille, switch to Stumbling Block. Fang will protect the party while You(Vanille) hit him with Saboteur attacks to drive up his Gestalt gauge. You should switch back and forth between Lifeguard and Stumbling Block till the big guys falls.
</p> 
<br><p>If this way doesn't try first create the Arcane Defense (ravager+Sentinel) start the battle same as last time but this time alternate between Stumbling block and Arcane Defense when you can attack. This should have the effect of raising and maintaining the chain gauge- the higher the chain gauge is the fastest the Gestalt gauge fills.  The trick to this style is the Renew Technique. You need to have the TP for at least one application of this technique, this removes the need to use the Lifeguard paradigm with you're on the ropes.
</p> 
<br><p>If you are almost there when the Doom counter hits around 100 try Slash and burn to drive the final nails in the metaphorical coffin of this Eidolon. Once the gauge is full, hit square to bring the battle to an end.
</p> 
<br><p>Hint you can use shrouds right before this fight if you are having a hard time. You can dismantle Doctor's Codes to get Fortisol and Aegisol in a pinch.
</p> 
<br><p>From here you're up against rust puddings, Pulsework Centurions and Cryohedrons for the first part of the Dusktide Grotto. Kick butt again and just carry on, watch your health. Try to get a preemptive strike on a group of Pulsework Centurions and Cryohedrons, both before and after the save point, other wise those fights may be hard to pull off. You could try just running past them if you want. Run right by the Jugggernaut at the save point here. Don't even try to fight it yet. we are no where near strong enough and we get to come back later in chapter 13 to complete any side quests we wish to, so there is no need to worry about that yet.
</p> 
<br><p>If you got to the right from the save point past the Juggernaut on the platform above and down to a small side platform you'll find
</p><p>There is a Boxed Phalanx that you can catch off guard at the start of the Deep in the Dark area. After the battle head to the end of the path and hop a ride on Atomos.
</p> 
<br><b>SIDE NOTE: </b>
<br><p>There are a few secret areas here that after you ride Atomos you can elect to go back and explore. The act of returning opens up 3 more map areas. Atomos is kind enough to complete a bridge to these sections. There are some spheres to collect there and several baddies to fight.
</p>

<br>Metal Armband(X2)
<br>Particle Accelerator(X2)
<br>Moogle Puppet

<br>Perfect Conductor(X4)
<br> 
<br><p>Since this is a main story guide, I'm not going to cover where these are located, but I'm going to tell you that most of the baddies we've already faced are in these new areas along with some new ones. The Ferruginous Pudding is one, it's weak to lighting and can be slowed. Strigoi and Vetala are others. Strigoi is weak to all elements, can't be provoked and is very strong, while Vetala is very resistant to damage. This little trait is reduced when it's staggered. Be careful and have fun exploring!

<br>Watch the really pretty cut scene and learn yet more about the backstory.
<br> 
<br><p>This is in fact a short area. Really simple and straight forward. There are spheres along the path that aren't hard to find. Just keep and eye out for them. In the Subterranean Lake area there is a dead end that sports many spheres for the plundering. To get to the spheres you'll need to defeat a few sets of baddies. But that's  nothing to worry aobut. When faced with a group of baddies that is a mix of Orobons and Ceratosaurs deafeat the ceratosaurs before going after the Orobons.

<br><b>Gameplay:</b>
<br> 
<br><p>Use the save point we passed on your way in to the area if you want. Watch the cut scene. This is not a place of underdeveloped parties. If you had trouble in the last area, you really need o think about going back and leveling up a bit before attempting this area.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so if you haven't been you need to work on Lighting's Commando role. I'm going to guess you've been using the same party I have made up of Lighting, Fang and Hope to this point. Stick with that. So back to Light, her commando role offers the skill Dispelga and an ATB segment, so work towards those. Get close if not to Fang's Sentinel role level and  work on Hope's ravager then Synergist and medic.
</p> 
<br><p>We are almost to our destination!! Yay! We just have to make it through this tower filled will baddies and we're good.
</p><p>So right off the bat there is a Cie'th stone. This one will as a waypoint or fast travel marker if you complete the hunt. This one isn't hard as it's a Goblin Chieftain that's just up the road a bit. So beat that up if you want.
</p> 
<br>Grab the sphere in farthest down corner of the area after the battle with the mark and minions.
<br> 
<br>Take down the cat piranha  hybrids and enter the tower.
<br><p>Watch the cut scene and then if you wish collect the spheres on this level. There are 3 in all. Use the save point by the ramp then take the strange elevator up.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so here we learn that we have to complete 3 missions in order to move on. The stats for each are listed above, but just for convenience sake, here they are again.

<br><p>OK this guy is big! but he will fall. He is weak to lighting and you can manually input the attacks to that the AI will catch on, or just use Libra or a librascope to get to the point. Hit him hard and heal with combat clinic as needed and this guy will fall.
</p>
<br><p>after the battle you can now move over and start the next mission. This time it's the Ambling Bellows we're after.

<br><p>Ok so from where we are now, you need to go all the way to the other side of the map. Ok here's the trick. Stay by the door till one of the funny red colored skinny Hoplites (known as Cryptos) comes near, then when it turns around to leave, attack it from behind and get this battle off to a preemptive start. Beat down the mark till it falls, don't worry about it's lackies and done worry about healing unless you have to. In a pinch Odin is always a way out.
</p> 
<br>Alright on to the next mission!

<br><p>Return to the middle room to find your next mark. Switch your default to Relentless Assault and sneak over to the critter and get the preemptive strike again to start this battle.  Just wail on the guy till he falls.
</p>
<br>yay the way is open!
<br> 
<br><p>Ok so now that the fire is out you can travel around. There is a sphere at the end of the walkway, collect it then back track to the door and go inside. Beat up the group of Pulsework Gladiators for 8000 cp.  Collect the sphere on the stairs up and move on to the next level.
</p> 
<br>Interact with the statue to gain access to the next part of the area.
<br><p>Grab the sphere all the way to the left before going on. Ride the musical elevator up to the next tier to the left( the side with the map maker) there is a sphere to grab before you start on the next quest. Now go the other way around the walk to grab another sphere and set of baddies to fight if you choose.  
</p> 
<br><p>You can take either elevator to the next tier. You'll be going back and forth between the tiers for the next little bit while you defeat the marks necessary to moving forward. You should be working towards Dispelga technique for your lead character. I've been using Light, Hope and Fang to this point and I don't plan on changing that for a while.
</p> 
<br><p>There are several treasure spheres around the area all of them are in plan sight in the backs and corners of the rooms. Since they aren't hard to find I'm not going to point them out unless they are a little hidden.

<br><p>When Vetala has it's shield up it cannot be harmed by Physical attacks and magic damage is halved. Stagger it to bring down it's shield.  It will cast it' shield again right before the stagger ends so hit it hard. You can inflict a variety of lasting status aliment on this creature to help things along. Heal when needed and you should come out on top.

<br><p>This guy is hanging out with some Chonchon that you should take care of first. Then once his lackeys are out of the way you can focus on beating this guy into the ground. Heal when needed and you'll do fine. For this mission you get the Diamond bangle and maybe with whistle wind scarf so not a bad haul for such a little guy.

<br><p>Yet again we have lackeys to deal with too. Take them out they're weak to water then work on the mark. I suggest beating the mark with pure physical strength since it doesn't have any weaknesses. Once that's done the middle elevator can go to the 6[SUP]th.[/SUP] Make your way to the maker on the map or where the Fal'Cie froze the ground to
</p>keep you from accessing the statue there.  
<br> 
<br> 
<br><p>Alright ride the final elevator tp the Apex. Save your game and get ready to fight that pesky Fal'Cie that's been buggering us. There are 2 treasure spheres on this level along with another statue. You can't active this one until you defeat the Fal'Cie, once that's done you can have access to the 7[SUP]th[/SUP] tier.

<br><p>Alright you wan to have Dispelga at this point. If you don't have it go learn it. I believe that everyone learns it but I've been working on Light, Hope and Fang so I l know they do. You want your main character to have that ability. You want to switch your default paradigm to Delta Attack before battle starts.
</p> 
<br><p>Now pay close attention to the on screen text. When you see Fulminouse Firestorm or Bone-Chilling Breaker switch to Combat Clinic right away. Dahaka will hit hard right off that you need to be able to heal from that right away, after that he will use less hard hitting blows. Stick with a defensive paradigm until he stops attacking or if you're feeling spunky or confident you could use Delta Attack or Solidarity to avoid losing chain gauge progress.
</p> 
<br><p>Dahaka has another nasty attack called Diluvial Plague which can inflict several negative status aliments on the entire party. Dispelga is the answer to your prayers in this situation.
</p> 
<br><p>Once stagger Dahaka falls to the ground and wont' attack till the stagger gauge drains. For this reason you should use Relentless Assault to really hit him hard. He is also susceptible to slow and other status aliments at this time so you might think about letting Fang or your saboteur inflict these aliments on the Fal'Cie.  You just need to make sure to switch to a paradigm with a sentinel before the Fal'Cie gets back up.
</p> 
<br><p>After a couple of staggers the Fal'Cie should fall. You'll get 33000 Cp and Tetradic Tiara for winning. 
</p> 
<br><p>From here you can either go to the statue here go to the top most level and gather the spheres there or you can use the other elevator and go on to the next part of the chapter.

<br><p>Ok so this is the last part for this chapter! Use the save point and make your way into the village proper.  Take the first left and grab the sphere at the end of the road.  You can accept the mission along the way, since it's right here in town and we have to go that way and beat them anyway so it's not a big deal.
</p> 
<br><p>Anyway head around the way and then enter the building at the end of the big area after the battle with the seekers and past the Vetala. Inside you will find Bhakti, an old friend of Vanille's. You can repair him and he will in return give you goodies. So here is were to collect the parts needed to repair the small rabbit like mech.
</p> 
<br><p>The battery pack can be found in the upper room of the building next to the house. You'll have to fight a Vetala for it. Use the same approach as we did for the mark and you'll do fine. The power cable is on the cart next to the large windmill on the sare outside. Head towards the map mark and along the way you'll jump some tree roots, the Vampire in the middle of these has the a part.  The aspheric Lens is in the school house guarded by a couple of Chonchons and a Vetala. The last one can be found between the depot and the rusted bridge areas.
</p> 
<br><p>So on your way outside again and back on the track of the game there is a sphere up the stairs before you fight the mark we took on earlier. Then there are two spheres on top of the school house. Inside the Depot there are 3 Taxim, the Vampire's weaker kid brother, so beat them up and carry on towards the marker.
</p> 
<br><p>If you haven't reached the role levels for lets face it everyone by this point. Do so now. There is a boss fight coming up that you will be glad at the cap for roles. Get all the off shoots too, those are the stat boosters that you really want.
</p> 
<br><p>Alright you want to have the Paradigm Mystic Tower (Ravager+ Ravager+ Sentinel) in your deck before going into the next boss fight. You should have reached the role level crystals for all core roles and you should have a full TP gauge. If you are lacking in any of these areas equip the Energy Sash and back track to fight the lesser baddies here before moving on.
</p> 
<br><p>So keep moving towards the waypoint on the may and be sure to save at the last save point on the bridge, past the Vampire and Seekers. Gather the Ethersol from the sphere use it if you need to and dig in for a long fight.

<br><p>This time around we don't have to defeat the creepy choir. Bart is easy to stager this time around, with a couple rounds of Delta Attack followed by Mystic Tower, but because he also came prepared to fight, his HP is higher than a bird's butt. So this is gonna take a while. Remember Start pauses the battle in case of much needed bathroom breaks.
</p> 
<br><p>So Bart doesn't have any one attack that is like knock you out of the park bad, but he will inflict status aliments all the time! I suggest not using Dispelga or Renew just yet, you will want your TP for later in the fight. Instead switch between Mystic Tower, Delta Attack and Combat Clinic, this will allow you to stay in the fight and still hit Bart hard. Now Thanatosian Laughter isn't funny at all. It can deal damage to the entire party, in big numbers. Nothing you can't heal from. With a sentinel as a damage sponge to soak up all that lazer action you are free to beat the crap out of this guy. 
</p> 
<br><p>This pain in the butt Fal'Cie casts Doom on your party leader at some point later in the battle. This time will only be about 2000. So it's a mad dash to the finish and if like me, he cast this when he still had a several hundred thousand hp, you are going to have to run to the finish. Remember that when you've summoned an Eidolon the timer is paused, so that's something and you can do some damage with Odin.
</p> 
<br><p>Just keep hitting at the guy till he falls. There isn't a whole lot that can be said on what else to do.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so that failed me the first time, so here's what I did the second time and I managed to just barely beat Bart. I stuck with Delta Attack till his stagger gauge was about at 150% then I switched to Mystic Tower till he was staggered then I switched to either Relentless Assault or Diversity while he was staggered, then back to Delta assault. I made quick stops to Combat Clinic to heal too. He cast Doom on me again but this time he cast it when he was closer to defeated. I then when all out with Relentless Assault and Diversity. I just whiled on him till he feel. I had a bunch of Foul Liquids and other items for healing thing when I couldn't do anything due to daze.  It took forever to beat him but in the end I just barely pulled this one from the jaws of defeat again.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so we got an expansion to our Crystarium, and Goddess Favor  for winning along with 100000 cp. When you're ready to move on make your way to the Cie'th stone near by. Don't worry you can come back to Pulse later on in chapter 13.
</p> 
<br>Watch the cut scene, then board the ship and get ready for a new chapter!!

<br><p>Ok so right off we are thrown in to battle, but don't worry it's easy enough. Once beaten a cut scene will play.  Ok so this area is a bunch of twists and turns but never fear we will get though it to the end! Let's start with our Crystarium. We need to have Haste, Curaja, Imperil, Stopga, Thundaga. If you are using Light, Hope and Fang, You'll want Army of One, Highwind, and Last Resort learned too. Now crystals are going to start costing around 10000 CP so you can leave the off shoots for now and come back to them once you have learned all the skills for that ring.
</p> 
<br>You paradigm deck should looks something like this
<br>Delta Attack= Ravager+ Commando+ Sentinel
<br>Mystic Tower= Ravager+ Ravager+ Sentinel
<br>Relentless Assault= Ravager + Ravager + Commando
<br>Evened Odds = Medic + Synergist + Saboteur
<br>Combat Clinic=+Medic + Medic + Sentinel.
<br>Protection = Medic + Sentinel + Synergist
<br> 
<br>I personally when with out Protection in favor of Diversity, but it's whatever works for you.
<br> 
<br><p>I'm going to suggest that you keep using Light, Hope and Fang, however if you can fill the party with other characters go right ahead. It's the skills that can make or break a boss fight not the character.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so back to our sky high maze here. There are 2 spheres in the area that you can collect along with several baddies to fight. The Bulwarkers are only a problem if they call up Targeting Beacons so take the beacons out fast to keep them from using Orbital Battery. One of these spheres contains Lionheart. Lionheart has the passive ability of Quick Stagger, which is AMAZING!
</p> 
<br><p>Now when you come to a fight with 2 sanctum Seraph and a Bulwarker take out the Mech first. Remember to get rid of the Targeting beacons as fast as you can.
</p> 
<br><p>Now don't let up on the Behemoth King. This guy is a bit of a challenge, stagger him if you can other wise really just wail on the guy till he falls. When sneaking around  area and you come across a Behemoth King and a few Orobon, I suggest using a shroud to sneak up on that group then take out the Behemoth first.
</p> 
<br><p>Keep your eyes peeled for a sphere out in the open.  The Proto Behemoth isn't a walk in the park but beatable, stagger him quickly and then juggle the beast in the air. Save a the save point and grab the near by sphere before moving on.

<br><p>You really need haste for this fight, if you don't have it I suggest going back and farming for the needed cp. I know in the little battles for go the protection Paradigm but for this fight you want to have it. So create it Start the battle with Protection in place and let Hope or your Synergist buff up the party.
</p> 
<br><p> OK so till after the first stagger this boss will use only one attack, that really annoying laser attack that can be just a little more than annoying. Stay on top of your healing and keep your Sentinel in place and you should do fine. After the first stagger things get a little harder.   He will use Limiters Deactivated, which will cast 3 permanent status buffs on the boss, followed by  Retaliatory Strike, which hit party members at random and can be a trick to deal with. There is a high change that your party leader could be hit several times in a row and be knocked out before you can heal. (unless you're playing a Fang as your party leader)((and she's in her sentinel role)) So once the party is buffed up and ready to do take a hop over to Delta attack and start building up the stagger gauge. Once about 40 or 50 % full switch over to mystic tower to finish staggering the boss, then back to Delta to hit him hard while he's staggers. About 10 seconds before the stagger ends, switch over to Combat Clinic, and heal your party prior to the coming storm. Once done let Light's ATB gauge fill and hold it in reserve to heal only her. If you start healing after each hit you should be able to keep her alive till the end of the attack.
</p> 
<br><p>At the end of the attack, Proudclad will go back to the laser attack and you can go back to protection if needed other wise switch to delta attack and start the stagger process again. Alright once beaten this guy drops a Particle Accelerator component once defeated.
</p> 
<br><p>So with the Proudclad out of our hair, we can now move on. After a elevator ride and a cut scene, we are up against an Adamanchelid. Now I know I told you to run earlier but now we can take this guy. Start off buy switching to Evened Odds and letting Fang de-buff the giant. Once that's done have you have some good buffs on your party, just start whacking at the creature with relentless assault till he falls. If you've been keeping up with me as the Crystarium goes he should fall in the first stagger. Save at the next save point and be sure to keep an eye out for a sphere near by.
</p> 
<br><p>Feel free to bypass these guys later on as the time and risk just aren't worth the CP or spoils you'd gain.
</p> 
<br><p>A bit after the Adamanchelid you'll fight an Humbaba. This dude is just a beefed up Behemoth, so start out with a round of delta attacks switch to Mystic Tower to build the stagger gauge, then once staggered switch to Relentless Assault. This will with any luck keep the massive creature from standing up and renewing his HP.  Humbaba is weak to fire, keep that in mind and maybe use Enfire.
</p> 
<br><p>When you come across a 3 way battle with a Humbaba  and some Corps& Sanctum guys, try to get a preemptive and then take out the bigger enemy first.
</p> 
<br><p>There are 2 spheres in the area, one down the off shoot to the right and the other out in the open.  Take the stairs down to the next level and use the same attack plan to take out the Proto-Behemoth that you did with the Humbaba.  And that Humbaba near by is dead so just run past it and open the door.
</p> 
<br><p>Alright gatecrashing! WOOT! Ok so this area is great for getting in on 3 way battles. With preemptive strikes, which are easy to get, and a hearty team you can take out the stronger, dangerous, and more time consuming baddies.
</p> 
<br><p>So anyway spheres, there are again 4 in this area, one down first right path around the 3 way battle with 3 Vampires and some Sanctum guys, another  at the furthest curve of the map, and 2 more on the last ring, one on the inner most ring where there are civies standing and the other on the middle inner ring that you can only access by passing or fighting a Tyrant.
</p> 
<br><p>Once you come to a battle between a Vernal Harvester and a Tyrant, sneak up on them, they won't notice a puny human like you, so get that preemptive strike. Now stagger the Harvester and attack it till just a fraction of it's health remains then switch to the Tyrant and do the same thing. This should allow you to defeat these powerful enemies quickly and little or no damage to you.
</p> 
<br>Ok Cut scene we're going the right way, through the door and on to the next area!
<br><p>Now this area is home to some of the more dangerous generic baddies we've fought to this point. This will be the first real chance we've had a beating a Juggernaut. If you choose to take on this mech, try for the preemptive and launch right off with relentless assault. As the first stagger ends, switch to protection and keep everyone healthy while the synergist buffs the party up. Then switch to  Mystic Tower/ Delta Attack to stagger your enemy again, then once staggered, use Relentless Assault till the stagger ends. Rinse and repeat till the Juggernaut bites the dust.
</p> 
<br><p>There is a sphere to our left down the little alley, and 4 once you enter the Edenhall proper. Remember the 2 spheres you first see upon entering, you can only open one for some strange reason. The one on the left contains 6 particle accelerators and the other a moogle puppet.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so DON'T FIGHT THE ADAMANTOISE! Just don't do it. Save and head straight into the building. Anyway there are spheres on either side of the room. Right then go through the door collect your sphere in the hall, save and head out the other side. After the cut scene head right for the Juggernaut and repeat the battle plan as before. There's any reason to fight the Tyrant other than the CP and spoils, so don't bother with the big blue guy unless you really want to. 
</p> 
<br><p>Make your way around to the stairs. After the cut scene grab the sphere that's up the stairs on the left and save your game if you wish.
</p> 
<br><p>Alright fight your way though the Cie'th and other baddies to the end of the path. Oh what's that at the end of the path?

<br><p>Alright, here we go. To start this time he's learned a new trick. He can change between 2 forms in this battle. When he does this it resets the stagger gauge. Annihilation Mode is on the ground and can be launched when staggered and the other is Aerial Defense Mode. This mode hovers over the battle field and can use that nasty attack Retaliatory Strike after being staggered. Like before you need to be in Combat Clinic before the end of the stagger and ready to heal your party leader.
</p> 
<br><p>Alright as with most bosses this guy is gonna hold out for the first part of the fight. Once you see Limiters Deactivate, the second part of the fight begins. Like before Limiters Deactive gives the Proudclad several status boost.  The boss also gains a new attack when on the ground called Oneiric Maelstorm, which will hit the party for various high amount of HP at a time. When on the ground you may have to stay in Combat Clinic just to stay alive. The best time to attack and re-buff is when the mech is in the air.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so keep at this and use Combat Clinic to heal,Delta Attack/Mystic Tower to stagger, and Protection to buff your party and you'll do fine. It might take what seems like forever but it will happen.
</p> 
<br><p>For winning you'll get 100000 cp, royal armlet and access to the store Eden Pharmaceuticals, where you can buy shrouds! Watch the cut scene and get ready to move on.
</p> 
<br>Guess what? FINAL CHAPTER!! WOOT WE'RE ALMOST DONE!

<br> 
<br><p>WOOT! Go us! We are at the final chapter! Right on! We have work our gamer thumbs to the bone and now here we are at the end, so take  a sec and congratulate yourself on getting here.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok let's not rest just yet we aren't done so let's get ready for this. Alright you remember me saying back in chapter 11 that we get to go back to Gran Pulse if we want/need? Well once in side the cradle 2 warp gates open up. One allows us to go back to the Edenhall map and the other takes us to Base Camp in Vallis Media. So If you want you can go back and do all those side quests and now you could even take on a few of the stronger baddies, but this is not your last chance to do so. If you haven't had any problems to this point or you're just itching to go mark hunting, just carry on. You can't get the last Crystarium expansion till after you be the final boss so it's usually just better to carry on from here. Again don't worry you'll have plenty of time to explore and beat up monsters after the credits role.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so unless your just really itching to fight something right off just ignore the Sacrifices here and move to the second  left and follow the path to the end collecting 3 spheres there.
</p> 
<br><p>So we gathered spheres and beat some baddies and now we're ready to move on to the next maker. There will be a shot cut scene, afterwards take the left platform and collect the sphere in this area. Then go back and take the right platform and collect those spheres before moving on.  Oh look at that a save point. Save if you want then examine the stature goddess thing to gain access to the next set of areas.
</p> 
<br><p>While running around this area you will encounter strange groupings of baddies. One of which is the Sacrifice and the Veleocycle. These guys are a deadly duo, but you can take ‘em. So here's what you do.  Take out the Sacrifice first, then the cycle.  Another is Sacrifice and Dragonites. Dispatch the Dragonites first or their rush attack will cause problems for you.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>There are 4 spheres in this area. One to the right and down, another to the right and up, and the third to the left and up. There is another to the back of the starting area behind a group of Sacrifices and a Velocycle. The Megrim Thresher can be a challenge however it can be de-buffed, so try to do so when fighting one of these, then use Relentless assault to take it out.
</p> 
<br><p>When faced with a group with a Sanctum Templar in it, take out the Templar fast. He hits hard but has a devastating attack called Charging Manadrive. This will inflict several debilitating status aliments on your party right before a near fatal lighting elemental attack, however lucky us this isn't really used during the first few moments of battle. The Templar can be launched, do so and juggle this guy in the air.
</p> 
<br><p>Now moving on the marker, there is a save point, use it if you wish, and get ready for a boss fight.
</p> 
<br><b>Boss Fight</b>

<br>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

<br><p>Ok so the Jabberywockey is immune to magic and the Bandersnatch is immune to physical attacks. The Jabberywokey can be hit with physical attacks but the damage is reduced to 1/10 and the Bandersnatch can be hit with magic but that damage is reduced by half. So what do we do Ed? Well you start with Evened Odds and let Fang de-buff the mighty beasts, while Hope buffs and Light heals. Ok so you want to make sure that Fang casts Deprotect on the Jabbery-baby-wockey, then you can enter Delta Attack or Mystic Tower, oh Champion and precede to kick butt! It will take a bit since Light's Commado is the only one that does real damage and Hope's Ravager helps to at least drive the stagger gauge up, while Fang takes the majority of the hits for us. Make sure to reapply Deprotect as needed throughout this part of the fight. Jabber-baby-wockey should fall with in a few staggers. Move on the frumious Bandersnatch now. Switch to evened odds and let Fang cast deshell, then swtich to relentless assault and let the party do their work. This should bring a fairly quick end to the fight.
</p> 
<br><p>Once this is over we are transported back to where we were before and a brief cut scene takes place. Save if you want and let's get ready to move on. We are so close can you feel it? I can.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so next area can be a bit of a challenge. This is where you will come across come strange combos of familiar baddies. These can get a little hard to handle. That being said the left path is most likely the easier of the two. You can evade the Cycles and get the jump on the others if you're careful or use a shroud.
</p> 
<br><p>In order to collect the spheres that are in this area you have to defeat the Immortal on the first ring, then use the waypoints. There are 4 in this area. I used a deceptisol to be the preemptive strike on the Mech, then just hit him hard with Relentless Assault till he fell, I only got hit once, but I'm going out on a limb here and gonna say that is not a typical result.  Now once the Immortal is beaten and you can warp to the upper and lower levels you aren't troubled by baddies till you come back to your original location. One of these spheres contains the first Elixir of the game.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so you can easily avoid the 2 Velocycles here,(going to the left ) and you can get the prermptive on the Templar and Thresher.  Take out the Templar first then weaken the Thresher with evened odds then take it out with Relentless assault. You'll have to fight a group of Sacrifices and a Thresher to be able to keep going. Try to get a preemptive on them, even use a shroud if you have one. Take out the Cie'th first then work on the bigger enemy.
</p> 
<br><p>Save your game here and use all the CP you have to this point, then set your default Paradigm to Protection.
</p>

<br><p>Alrigthy then! Let's do this thing! Ok so this guy hit hard and has a rather nasty ability called Mounting Contempt which will cast Deprotect and/or deshell on the party right before a mean physical attack. This can take out a party member. Now what we do to win this thing is let Hope buff <b> *</b>claps  * us up. Once that's in place and if we get hit with this ability the buffs will just go away and that is our cue to switch to protection and let Hope re apply the buff.
</p> 
<br><p>So we have buffed up party now what? Well switch to Delta attack and just wail on the Cie'th till it falls.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>From here, use the save point then move toward the strange goddess statues that either want to help or kill us, and wait for the next area to be created. Ok so there is a “hidden” elevator in the corner but leave it for now, and go up the ramp instead. There are 2 spheres on the platform, both containing gil.  Granted that you have to fight some old friends to get them, but it's up to you. The fact that these former bosses still drop the same amount of CP for a regular battle is awesome! This is a good place to farm. So keep in mind while you are here that once you go through the warp point you can't return to this spot again, without using a previous save. So take some time and power level, it can only help you in the long run. I suggest getting as close as you can to completing available Crystarium as you can stand.  To make these baddies re-spawn run to the save point on the lower level.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>Once you've leveled to your heart content or as far as you can stand, head towards the marker. The group of Sanctum Templars can be a hassle but if you stay with your healing you can get them. You still have the option of power leveling at this point if you want to, other wise use the warp point and dig in for yet another boss fight.

<br><p>OK So this guy has 2 stages, one fly and one on the ground and it usually changes after a stagger ends.
</p> 
<br><p>OMG this is one very long battle, I feel asleep during it. But that aside, here's what you do, mind numbing as it is. When it's off the ground Tiamat's attack inflict  status aliments and when it's on the ground it's attacks take status buffs away.
</p><p>When in the air most of it's attacks aren't anything to worry about, they're really just more annoying than anything, however Tail Hammer will launch the party into the air. Overdrive gives the Mech buffs, that you can have Fang remove in Evened odds, but it might be safer to stay with her as a sentinel. Use protection long enough to get Haste on Hope and Light then switch to Mystic Tower or Delta attack for a quick stagger.
</p> 
<br><p>When you see Descent text on the screen the mech is landing and when staggered can be launched, this might be a good time to then chance, Relentless Assault. When the stagger is over the mech will take to the air again. Rinse and repeat till beaten.
</p> 
<br><p>Now after this fight you can't go back, so I suggest creating a separate save file so if you aren't ready you can come back to the CP gold mind we just left behind. That being said we will have the chance to return to Pulse before the final boss again.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so this is the final area of the game! We made it. Now if you find your self lacking in the coming battles you can return to the start of Orphan's Cradle and journey to Pulse or the Edenhall to gather some PC. Buy 2 cherb's crowns from the shops and make sure you have no less that 5 phoenix downs for the up coming fights. These are back to back. 
</p> 
<br><p>If you want to take the time and do some  of the side quests you can but again you don't get the final level of the Crystrium till after the final boss fights, so keep that in mind as you travel the expansive world.

</p><p>Alright this is the last time we're going to see this guy so let's make it count. In the incarnation Bart only has three attacks. The laser is back, along with the lesser seen Ultima, that does moderate damage to well buffed parties, again Thanatosian Laughter. So once you're buffed and ready to fight, (which you can use a shroud to start the fight if you wish) use Delta Attack or Mystic Tower to pound away at this Fal'Cie. Once staggered you could if  you're brave switch to Relentless assault, but keep in mind that when you see Thanatosian Laughter text on screen, switch to Combat Clinic right away. If the battle goes on for 20 minuets Bart will cast Doom on the party leader. If your party is buffed up enough you shouldn't have this problem.

<br><p>There is no rest for the wicked. We are thrown right in to this battle after that grueling fight with Bart. So once the battle starts, pause and select retry. When the main menu pop up replace Protection with Agression (Commando(X2) + ravager) and set combat clinic as your active paradigm.  Make sure to equip as many Cherb's crowns as you can on Light. This will be a great help later in this fight.
</p> 
<br><p>Ok so Orphan has 2 modes in this fight. Consume dark and Consume Light. When it moves between these two modes it follows the change with an attack called Merciless Judgment, which hits all party members for massive damage. Always shift to combat clinic when you see the text on screen to avoid dying and having to start the battles over again. 
</p> 
<br><p>After recovering from Orphan's welcome, switch to Evened Odds and wait for the others to buff and de-buff till Hope has put 6 puffs on each character. Once done switch to relentless assault, healing with combat clinic when any characters hp hits about 50%. Right before the first stagger ends switch to Combat Clinic, because Orphan is going to whip out Merciless Judgment again.
</p> 
<br><p>When it's in Consume Darkness mode Orphan will use stronger attacks that have the added ability to inflict status aliments on the party. Just let them be and keep hitting Orphan with Relentless assault. You need to fill the change gauge as fast as possible right now, with limited breaks to heal. Once staggered it will not attack in Consume Dark mode. So rather than hitting it hard while staggered renew your buffs and it's de-buffs then if you have time hit it hard.
</p> 
<br><p>Once again after recovering from Merciless Judgment, hop back to Relentless Assault. You should be doing a good job of bringing down Oprhan's hp. Just when you think you have it in the bag, this guy will pull out a couple of dirty tricks. First Merciless Judgment starts to happen any old time and the second is that it starts using an attack called Progenitorial Wrath. This nasty piece of work can kill any character targeted no matter their current status. So yeah not very nice. This is the reason for those Cherub's Crowns, in order to boost Light's chances of not being killed when targeted. If any one else falls use a phoenix down.
</p> 
<br> 
<br><p>Later on things start to get will unpredictable. Orphan will attack with any of it's attack at random and this can cause some headache. When staggered fill the gauge to 999% the switch to Aggression and let the commandos just wreak havoc on it. You should be using these and Orphan should fall in about 10 minuets or so.

<br><p>Ok so there's a pesky Doom counter just ticking away, so right off the bat go into Relentless Assault and just attack Orphan. In this form Orphan is immune to damage till staggered. Once staggered though it can be launched, thought it can still attack while in the air. You can use Light's Army of One ability to build the stagger gauge. You'll have to select this one manually but all in all still a great ability to use.
</p> 
<br><p>Keep an eye on everyone's HP and heal when needed. Like in the first battle when the stagger gauge hits 999% switch to Aggression and let the commandos have go at it. When the stagger ends switch to Evened odds and let Fang dispel any of Orphan's buffs while Hope buffs you * Clap * up after it performs Rebirth. Once that's done rinse and repeat till beaten. If all goes well you should be able to defeat this guys in the third stagger.
</p> 
<br><p>Woot! That's the end Congrats! Watch you're well deserved end scenes and sit back! You beat Final Fantasy XIII!</p>
