Noctis is the heir to the throne of Lucis. Noctis and another person, a woman named Stella, are able to see a "light" that allows them to predict people's deaths. This light comes from the legend of the Goddess of Death, Etro, who is said to greet the souls of the deceased by opening the door to the afterlife. When the door opens, the souls of the departed burst out in a streak of light, a light which very few can see.

Lucis is a country holding the world's last crystal which is beneficial to its military, economic, and political standing. Because of its apparent industrialization compared to its neighbouring countries, Lucis has isolated itself from the rest of the world.

At one time, all of the other countries had crystals, but lost them to war and fighting. They used all of their resources on weapons and warfare, gaining things like firearms and magic, but in the process they neglected other social aspects which led to diminishing quality of life. Lucis was in a cold war with the rest of the world over the use of the last crystal, but a peace treaty was recently signed to end the stand-off.

However, under the guise of peace, the Kingdom of Niflheim broke the treaty and conquered the nations of Solheim, Tenebrae, and Accordo, before attacking Lucis to steal the crystal.
