[B]+ Goon x2[/B]

If you want, you can steal Budget Grenades from the two Goons. It is recommended you steal the High Potion from ???? as they aren't easy to purchase at this stage of the game. If you use a Budget Grenade, it will deal heavy damage to all 3. The fight isn't difficult, so you can easily just take out the two goons and then focus on using Rikku and Paine to attack in succession for chain damage. 

[HR][/HR]
Once the boss fight is complete, you will be chasing ???? through the Luca docks. Make sure you stop at the second dock and head to the left to find the "hiding" Moogle. If you speak with it, it will heal your HP. It's also necessary in order to achieve 100% game completion. The goons will keep coming, so if you have the extra time and HP, you can steal some Budget Grenades from them for one of the future dresspheres.

Continue along until you witness a scene. You now can use Yuna in battle for the next Boss Fight.

I recommend you steal the accessories from Logos and Ormi. Logos can occasionally use a Potion on him or Ormi and he attacks quicker, so it is recommended you take him out first, followed by Ormi. Once that fight is over, you will immediately be thrown in to your next boss fight. Leblanc will hand you back your garment grid along with the Songstress dressphere.

This battle is mostly a tutorial for switching Dresspheres. Press the L1 button and make Yuna in to a Songstress, If you continuously cast Darkness Dance on Leblanc, she will miss most of her hits, making it a fairly easy battle. You can steal from her if you want. Once the battle is over, you will see a dancing Yuna scene and be brought aboard the Celsius Airship.

Follow the instructions to learn how to jump and climb by pressing O. Move to the place where you can see the treasure and drop down (don't jump). The treasure chest contains the Yellow Ring. Climb back up the ledge behind you and then jump across to the next ledge. Head down the stairs. After the scene, press the glowing button to activate the elevator. 

When you reach the bottom, head to the left where you see the floating ledges in front of the waterfall and then climb up the wall to get a treasure that contains an Elixir. Head back the way you came from the ledges and head to the right from there until you climb up to a suspended road. Here, you will have another boss fight.

There are 3 accessories you can steal if you have a thief in your party. A good strategy is to have a Songstress use Darkness Dance to keep the enemy blinded so that they miss more often. Eliminate Leblanc first as she can damage the whole party and also aid the other two.

Once the boss fight is complete, you will be set on a timer. You [I]can[/I] collect all of the items in the time given, but if you find yourself short of time, you can always return later on and claim the items you missed. 

Run to the far end of the ruined road to find a Mega Phoenix. Afterwards, head to the doorway, ignoring the fallen columns that lead up. Once you reach the opening, Logos will set some Goons after you. The time stops during fights, but not while he's talking before hand, so skip the dialogue if you read faster than they speak.

[CENTER] 
[/CENTER]
Once you enter the temple, move left or right and climb the ledge to find a switch. Activating the switches lowers a column in a connecting hallway, but this isn't necessary to complete the mission. Head north from where you entered and drop down in to a pit to find a White Ring. Climb out of the pit and jump across the platforms and head North. 

If you want to, at the intersection, head right. If you pressed the switches, you will be able to access this area. Continue along until you find the chest containing the Red Ring.

Head back to the intersection, but this time take the other path. If you chose to skip the last step, just head north at the intersection. Follow the road outside of the temple and Ormi will send more goons after you. After the fight, continue along until you climb up to a ledge. Follow the ledge to the end and you'll reach a chest containing a Star Pendant.

[CENTER] 
[/CENTER]
Head back from the ledge and keep as close as you can to the side not against the wall. Eventually you will see the option to jump on to a different ledge. Jump over and continue along and you will soon see the timer stop. If you beat Leblanc to the top you will be able to claim the treasure chest where she is hanging which contains the Muscle Belt. Continue up the stairs.

Once you reach the top, you will have another boss fight.

[LEFT]This is the most difficult battle yet, but it's still pretty straightforward. He can hit for 50 HP sometimes, so if you want to, you can use a Songstress to cast Darkness Dance and get him to miss your party more often. The biggest threat is if he uses Sticky End, which casts Stop on your characters. In case they all get hit, try to keep your HP over 70 because you'll have to wait for the effect to wear off. A Remedy can also cure it if any of your characters don't get hit.
